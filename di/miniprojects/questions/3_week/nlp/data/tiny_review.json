That said, I have so no such qualms about revealing their absolutely HORRENDOUS customer service practices.\n\nI spoke to a representative yesterday to sign up for internet service at my new apartment.  I specifically asked the representative if there were any promotions currently available, in order to receive the best price possible.  He quoted me 39.99 as their only current promotion for basic internet (not including moden/router rentals, upgraded speed, etc.) Taking him at his word, I accepted, and scheduled an installation.  Thus begins the tale of woe:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n-  Later that night, on the internet:  I see advertised in giant, bold, colorful letters, $24.99 for basic internet.  Just about half the price of the \"promotion\" the representative offered me.\n\n-  I call the representative line to find out what I was told a blatant lie (in nicer terms, of course).  He confirms the promotion is available, but he doesn't have authority to change me to that price. TRANSFER 1, TO SALES!\n\n- Sales also confirms the much cheaper promotion, but says it is an online-only offer, and she absolutely cannot give it to me:  I can only receive it online, and I will need to reschedule my installation.  TRANSFER 2, TO THE INTERNET!\n\n- The internet promotion finds my address alright, but instead of being able to sign up online, every time I reach the promotion page for my address, I receive the same error message:  \"Your session has timed out or encountered an error. Please start over or click the \"Back Button\" on your browser. If you still wish to contact us.\"  This occurs over 3 different computers and the same number of unique browsers.  TRANSFER 3, TO THE ONLINE-CHAT REPRESENTATIVE!\n\n-  Online chat confirms again that the service is available, but I cannot achieve it online, only over the phone.  Having just been told the *exact opposite*, i attempt to point out the circular logic there, but to no avail. Apparently, reducing my price to their own advertised offer would be considered \"downgrading\" a customer, and he is not allowed to do that. TRANSFER 4, TO THE PHONE REPRESENTATIVE (AGAIN)!\n\n-  The new phone representative tells me that as I am NOT a customer, she cannot help me at all.  Still loving the contradictions (the last one claimed that she could not downgrade customers, now I'm not even a customer?  Really?), I try to argue, but she claims sales needs to handle me, and transfers my call.  TRANSFER 5, TO SALES (AGAIN)!\n\n- And at this point, after another few minutes of lovely Charter advertisements and soothingly torturous elevator music, I am transferred to... a voice mail.  This proceeds to Inform me that the Sales Depts. hours are over, so please call back later, and then terminates the call.\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\n3 fun filled hours of lies, contradictions, and a misinformation campaign that would dazzle ANY public figure later... absolutely nothing was accomplished, except a gigantic waste of my life and a review that will hopefully reveal these horrifying business practices to all those unsuspecting cable-seeking fellows on Yelp.\n\nBeware.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oLctHIA1AxmsgOuu4dM6Vw"}

Just ditched them and I couldn't be happier. Shortly after we first started with Charter our connection went out, took them days to send someone out and it turned out they'd disconnected us for no reason at all. Thanks Charter. Fast forward to the recent past when our bill went up, I called up to try and get a new promotional rate because I'm no paying $60 for internet that bombs out briefly a couple times a day. They said they couldn't do anything better than their listed rate. \nAfter that I decided to downgrade to their lowest speed for the time being in order to save some money. When I called up to do so they transferred me to retentions and magically they offered me a better rate. Turned out they were lying and there was an additional charge on top of that because I wasn't bundling serviced (I have no interest in rotting my brain out watching cable TV or having a phone that I can't take with me in my pocket), when I complained and asked for the original rate the supervisor did not apologize and said the last person I talked to must have assumed I knew about the extra fee. When I told her I wanted the original rate she said there was nothing she could do, what is the point of having a retentions department if the best they can do is what is listed on the website?\nFinally I organized DSL with AT&T which was simple and easy and did not require a visit for installation. I just plugged the DSL modem in and called customer service who guided me through the set up. When I called to cancel with Charter they offered me the original rate but I'm pretty sure it would have been the same thing again. After calling to disconnect I got several calls from Charter trying to get my business back if perhaps they offered me a really good rate but by that point they'd managed to blow whatever shred of credibility they had left in my mind.

What I mean by this is the quality of the meals and the atmosphere of this supper club is good enough to warrant return visits but not to elicit rave reviews.  I'm not a supper club kind of guy, so right off the bat a place like the Green Lantern isn't going to be my favorite.  However there are plenty of old school supper clubs that do a nice enough job that I've got no qualms tagging along for dinner on a Friday night.  The Green Lantern is one of these places, albeit just barely.\n\nMy friend, however, absolutely loves this place.  As such I've had cause to dine here many times over the years.  There are quite a few pluses.  The bartenders are quick and generally friendly, and they've got an adequate tap selection including Ale Asylum offerings.  I love the location right off the lake, and two-thirds of the seating areas have great atmosphere.  The service has always been above average and I can't think of a bad experience - this type of consistency over the years is very hard to maintain.  They've got Wiggies, which are kind of like low-rent roesti - hashbrowns with onions, peppers and American cheese.  And finally the Green Lantern is obviously popular with the denizens of McFarland.  I don't recall a single trip out here where the bar wasn't mostly full and the restaurant hopping.\n\nThe negatives: first and foremost I've always found the menu to be pretty limited.  I'm not big on fish fry, and the Green Lantern's Friday night menu doesn't have much else aside from sandwiches and a grilled chicken breast entree.  Now as I said, I'm not big on fish fry so my opinion should be taken lightly, but the times that I have ordered the fish I've been underwhelmed.  This is probably just me - my friend simply can't get enough of the stuff.  Prices are moderately high for the perceived quality, though the bar is quite reasonable.  There's also a bit of a hassle when it comes to paying the bill.  While I've never had any concerns with service from the waitstaff, I have stood around for upwards of 15 minutes waiting to have the hostess swipe my card.  That is unacceptable and it's unfortunately led to smaller tips to otherwise deserving waitresses.  Finally, it always seems that after waiting 20-30 minutes for a table on a Friday night we always end up either in the basement or at one of the few poorly located tables upstairs.  \n\nIf it were just up to me I don't think I'd be going to the Green Lantern all that much.  After all, I don't live in McFarland and I don't really go for supper club fish fries.  But so long as I know people that love going here I'll tag along and have a decent enough time.  I think you'd be hard pressed not to at least be able to do that at the Green Lantern.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rdAdANPNOcvUtoFgcaY9KA"}

There are a few places in the mag that I am looking forward to trying but Green Lantern was the first one that we hit up.  \n\nDriving up the place looked kind of small and beat up which was not what I was expecting and not looking forward to.  As we got closer however I realized how big this place was on the inside.  It's huge!   At least it felt huge from where we were sitting.  I'm not sure if it was the article in the magazine that attributed to how crazy busy this place was or if there was a concert or what but this place was insane.  I mean we had to wait for an hour for our table.  On the plus side we had to wait an hour for our table which meant an hour of drinking so I can't really complain.\n\nBecause we had been waiting for so long we also had a chance to look at the menu so when we  finally sat down we knew exactly what we wanted; the waitress loved this.  We started with the calamari which I'm starting to find out is not one of Wisconsin's strong suits.  I don't think I have ever had good calamari here; maybe this will be my next food challenge 'The Great Calamari Showdown'!  Anyway, I had a few pieces of that and let the man have the rest'' he actually really liked it.  \n\nI ordered the salad which was huge, cheesy mashed potato, and 3 pieces of the lightly breaded cod.  The man order the same but with cheesy hash browns.  The fish was pretty good.  It was juicy and fresh and not bad.  I thought it was maybe just a little over the top with the seasoning.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if the flavors were a bit more subtle as opposed to all up in my face the way it was.  With that said however I though it was alright.  The man on the other hand was in love.  He likened his enjoyment of this place to the Tornado Room.  Pure blasphemy.  He clearly doesn't know anything about food. \n\nAll in all I am glad I tried this place but I don't think I will be making it a regular haunt.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rdAdANPNOcvUtoFgcaY9KA"}

And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday).  Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  God bless America.\n\nThe AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).  As breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).\n\nSo give it to me hard backwoods Wisconsin.  Give me every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody Mary drinking, being.  Just be.  And give me a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me digest the spectacle, with scrambled eggs on the side.  And don't you dare forget the tartar sauce.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_wZTYYL7cutanzAnJUTGMA"}

Now I am well aware of the number of bones that a whole Walleye contains and cannot in any way hold the Beach House responsible for that. I can say that the breading was perfectly crispy and well seasoned and that the fish was not at all over cooked, nice and moist. plus I think it cost $10 which was awesome (you can't get fish for breakfast at these prices in Chicago) \n\nFor me the biggest highlight of breakfast here is what they do to the potatoes (their name for them is eluding me at the moment) by request they will top your breakfast potatoes with a heap of meat, veggies and cheese, enough to make it a hangover-soaking-up meal unto itself.\n\nTo sum it all up: if you find yourself looking for breakfast and a little \"hair o' the dog\" in McFarland Wisconsin because \"What happens at the Beach House, stays at the Beach House\" and we all love that about any restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_wZTYYL7cutanzAnJUTGMA"}

They had lots of specials going on that night (Friday night fish!), and we started with pepperjack cheese curds.  Delish!  They had a really nice bite at the end of them from the peppers.  I got the blue gill/lake perch combo and my fiancee got the Caribbean salmon.  I know blue gill is a thinner fish, and while my dish was good, there was not a lot of actual fish under the batter.  I got a salad with my fish with a tomato basil vinaigrette, which was surprisingly good and coleslaw which was pretty standard.  The salmon with the Caribbean dipping sauce was fantastic, but the veggies he got as a side was just some steamed broccoli and carrots- not very creative!

After this cozy little place I'm a bed and breakfast faithful.  \n\nOur host, Craig, was wonderful.  It was super easy to make the arrangements and the website was helpful.  The place itself gave me the same joy I remember having when I would go see grandparents as a child.  That feeling of a warm house.  Oh, did I mention that when we first entered the whole house smelled of breakfast from that morning.  \n\nThe bed half of the name was extra comfortable and the room was very relaxing.  We stayed in the Sorenson room, which was a little larger and had a couch.  They offered a small bookshelf of books and Madison magazine (which helped us to find our restaurant the next day).  The Sorenson room also offers a private bathroom with a claw-foot tub that is over 110 years old (but has excellent water pressure).  Shampoo, soap, body gel, bath salts (I think that's what they were), and even a hairdryer are all provided.  This was nice since we forgot a couple of those things.  \n\nFor the breakfast portion, we had a spinach and cheddar quiche that was the fluffiest damn quiche I've ever had.  Pardon my French! My fiance is a Vegetarian and it was extremely easy to make.  He also had a myriad of drink options.  Some ready to be poured, some in waiting.  Also, for me (the non-vegetarian), he made an incredible side of bacon.  It was sprinkled with brown sugar and then generously peppered.  Then it was baked.  Then it was devoured with great speed.  Seriously, this was heavenly.  Also, there was a delicious pear and cranberry compote for each of us. \n\nCraig and his beautiful (and friendly) dog joined us for breakfast and some wonderful conversation.  He is a true gentleman and an excellent host.  \n\nMy fiance and I are planning another trip in the spring and we'll be sure to stay with them again.

We were going up to Madison for the day and found this place through a quick Google search of Madison-area B&B's.  Craig (the owner) was so helpful and friendly when I called to inquire about prices and availability.  He was also awesome and asked about our dietary preferences (I'm a vegetarian who's also temporarily gluten-free, whereas my boyfriend will eat anything) and promised to have a yummy breakfast we would both love.  When we got to The Parsonage, I was so happy we decided to stay there instead of in Madison proper.  It was quiet and cozy.  We picked the Mentor room which had a big awesome jacuzzi tub in there, and also a really nice outdoor patio (which was covered in snow, but i bet will be awesome when spring comes!).   Our bed was SO COMFORTABLE, i think i actually miss it.  Since our room didn't have a shower (which we knew when we booked - well worth it to have that awesome bathtub!), I used the shared bathroom on the second floor which was also very nice and cozy.  Breakfast the next day was so nice.  Craig made homemade cranberry orange muffins with a cheesy kale egg dish - so yummy!  Everyone else got delicious smelling bacon, and Craig very awesomely made me veggie breakfast sausage.  There was also pineapple, juice, and a really great tea selection.  The conversation was also really nice - I like that we all ate together (me, my boyfriend, Craig, and the 5 other guests who were staying there.  Great people and great company.  Next time we are in the Madison area, we will definitely stay here.  Craig, thanks for all the hospitality!  From Denise and Justin", "type": "review", "business_id": "XrzTVrJAjs0yYLvhFI9vkQ"}

Street parking.

Craig went out of his way to make me feel comfortable with the house, the amenities, where to find him if I needed something, etc. I called him later that night after I realized I had accidentally left without a key, and he told me exactly where he would hide one outside for my return. It felt less like paid lodging, and more like staying with distant relatives. \nOur group had some gluten-sensitive members and some lactose-sensitive members, so Craig made sure that each breakfast had options for everyone. One morning, the power went out around 5am before he could cook the breakfast casserole, so he ran down to a bakery and brought back an improvised meal of fruits and a kringle (?), a local specialty. The weather was nice, so we spent plenty of time on his newly renovated screened-in porch listening to music while we sipped coffee and rubbed Coriander's belly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XrzTVrJAjs0yYLvhFI9vkQ"}

I didn't want to drive to the East Side for the Esquire Club. I was reluctant to try take out fish fry because I was worried about fried food getting soggy. \n\nI gave it a shot and I was impressed! \n\nFirst, the fish to beading ratio was really good. Big thick pieces of flaky fish with a dense, probably corn meal based, and crumb-style breaking (as opposed to the extra greasy tempura- style batter). It was nice and crunchy and the breading stayed that way on my 5-10 minute drive home. Tip: crack the styrofoam container to let the steam out for extra insurance against soggy fish. Served with a lemon. \n\nThe fries were coated in something that made them extra crispy and they had a good seasoning. \n\nThe slaw had good flavor but lots of dressing. Purists might say it was over dressed; others might say its just right. \n\nTarter sauce was a little sweet and tangy, which was good contrast with the fish. The server gladly gave me extra. \n\nThe bun was just as you would expect from a supper club, cheap, white, and doughy. Served with a butter chip. \n\nEverything was served together in a box; everything you need except several icy cold beers.\n\nThe service was fine. The take out window was nice. It takes a few minutes for the order but I think they fry-to-order which is well worth it to me and a big plus. Any you cut it, it takes less time than waiting in line for dine in Friday Fish Fry.\n\nA little spendy for take out fish fry ringing up at over $25 for two dinners.

I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  I was wrong.  The breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically  sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Ma-po Tofu.  He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).

I had to ask several times for a glass of water.  The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.  By this time, I drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off.  I tried to ask for some, but she walked away.  \n\nPlus, I thought it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant - what's with the Vivaldi and Mozart soundtrack?\n\nSkip this place all together and hit up the Asian grocery and gas station next door.

This particular night was at the end of summer and there was an amazing thunderstorm about to occur. SO on this stormy night we decided on Chinese and I had recommended we drive to Middleton for what I had heard to be the best around.\nOk..so after a short 15 min drive we had a great parking spot...  ran inside and were greeted with a warming beautiful atmosphere.. very welcoming large foyer, nice bar area which u walk thru to get to your dining area.\nAfter the immediate seating, WE were greeted  by a pleasant asian woman and ordered drinks. which turned out to be just right.\n\nAppetizers were mediocre...nothing to remember...we had the app for two...calamari was HORRIBLE  btw  I could go into so much detail but who is gonna read all that....the following is my reason for writing...\n\nMy forewarning is NOT TO TRUST in ordering the Lobster dish. I wanted a decadent treat for myself and decided on the (market price) 45$ Lobster dinner entree which came with two choices of preparation. Ginger sauce or garlic butter  i ordered the garlic but the server said no the other was best.\nMore importantly i asked her how large the lobster was and if it was sold by pound cause it was listed as Market Price. She said she would inquire before i ordered and returned to our table and said it was 2.5 pds or larger. So that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering. I thought 45 dollars was a great price for a generous 2.5 pd lobster entree.\nWhat arrived on my plate was a cut up overly sauced jigsawed puzzled lobster animation on a platter which was in no way a 2.5 pound creature to begin with. It was dismantled then pieced together to look like a lobster shape. The meat was still in shell. (and I mean IN SHELL).  There was hardly any meat to be had. The tail which should have been the meatiest portion was cut in one inch pieces with shell INTACT and had yielded maybe 2 morsel of meat total.  I was shocked as i struggled to manipulate any source of goodness from the pieces of crustacean.There was literally no lobster and what was there was swimming in overpowering sticky sauce. All in all an EXTREME disappointment. Not what I was expecting in the LEAST!!\n\nAs the storm gained intensity outdoors, my high hopes and any thoughts of returning to this eatery were un-intensified. I will NEVER return. I cannot tolerate being misled by a server\n We ended up tipping and not making a fuss...just another lesson learned. The storm raged on , I did get to spend time with my son and hopefully educate you..

The waitstaff has always been attentive and professional, and the wait time for food is reasonably short. The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.\n\nBut none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out. I now double-check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.\n\nI did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices.

I have never come away unimpressed with either the food or the service.  I can't really speak to authenticity since I wouldn't really know it if I saw it, but for what they do Mi Cocina does it well.  All I do know is that I have gotten my favorites here over and over without ever having any problems.  The staff is always friendly and fast which sets the place apart from several other area restaurants of the genre.  If only for consistency I would rate Mi Cocina a three, and with never having a bad meal I definitely would go with a high 3.5 - 4 stars.\n\nLast time I had the fried tilapia tacos, and I especially enjoyed the spicy cream-based sauce that was served on the side.  It was perfectly seasoned for my taste, though it was a bit hot for my mother.  The tilapia was lightly fried and was still tender.  The accompanying refried beans were decent, and served to allow for the spice from the tacos to dissipate.  I still put the blackened tilapia tacos at Tex Tubbs at the top of my favorites list, but these easily jumped to the #2 position.  On previous trips I've gotten flautas, which were perfectly fried and not too crispy, and the enchiladas sonora, which comes with an excellent spinach and a creamy sauce.  I also really enjoy the cheese and mushroom quesidilla and the fajitas.  My sister, who is lactose-intolerant, had found the menu a bit dairy-laden, but she did end up finding a chicken breast entree that is now her favorite.  The prices are quite reasonable and given the amount of food always a good deal.  Mi Cocina probably won't ever be held up as a paragon of the style, but it has always been reliable and enjoyable and for that I'll keep coming back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "77ESrCo7hQ96VpCWWdvoxg"}

So, our small group made our way back toward the Middleton and decided to take a short walk over to Mi Cocina.\n\nWe arrived at around 6:00pm on a Sunday and were promptly seated.  The waiter brought us chips and salsa immediately, and then took our drink orders.  Within a few minutes, our sodas arrived, along with a cheese dip.\n\nWe quickly scarfed down the salsa and cheese dip; the salsa was initially mild but then had a nice little kick to it at the end.  The chips were a thicker cut chip; they weren't the slightest bit greasy.  The queso was excellent - nice and hearty, white cheese, delicious.\n\nWe ordered our entrees and within minutes our food was available.  There was a slight mix-up with my order - I had requested chicken burritos but received beef.  No big deal; the beef burritos were decent - some chunks of potato were an interesting touch.\n\nMy dining partner ordered a sampler plate, which came with a chicken burrito, a chicken enchilada, and a tamale.  It was good as well; the chicken was far better than the ground beef.\n\nService was beyond excellent - very fast, very attentive, and as such, we left a nice tip.  Only complaints?  A tad pricey - our meal was $26 without any beers/margaritas, and there were a ton of kids in there, which was a bit distracting.

We had just purchased it earlier that year. It was a certified used vehicle so it was still under warranty. We called Acura Roadside Assistance and they sent out a tow truck that jumped us so that we could drive to the nearest dealer to have the car looked at and fixed. The closest Acura dealer was Zimbrick of Middleton and we dealt with Shane (the manager) in the service department. They replaced the battery in our car and then informed us that our car now had a check engine light on. We asked if they could pull the codes and tell us what was wrong or even clear them and see if they came back. He told us that we would have to take the car in its current condition with the light on because he said, \"It's the day after Christmas and I just don't have the manpower to deal with it.\". My Husband reiterated to Shane that he please just pull the codes so that we have an idea of what we were dealing with, Shane refused. We were worried about taking the car as we were traveling from Minneapolis to Chicago and it already broke down on us once. Plus, with the delay of the battery ordeal we'd be getting into Chicago during rush hour. We decided to cancel our hotel reservation that we had for that night in Chicago and called Acura of Brookfield. They said they could get us in first thing the next morning to scan it and see why there was a check engine light on. So we spent the night in Brookfield and that dealer took great care of us! They even reserved a rental car in case it was needed. I just wish that's who we would've went to first. Oh, and I forgot to mention earlier...Zimbrick of Middleton put a three inch black scuff on the drivers side rear quarter panel of our white car while it was in the shop. When we noticed it and went in to ask Shane to take a look at it he became extremely short with us and was down right rude. He implied to us that it was there from before and it clearly was not.

If I reviewed my first stay if probably would have been 2 or 3 stars. Lucky for them.  \n\nBack to my most recent stay.  It was the best experience ever.  (Second to the Double Tree in Carmel, IN.)  I walked in the lobby around 1PM and was greeted by Bobbie.  He was handling the desk by himself and I explained that we would wait in the lobby until they had a room ready (since we were 2 hours early for check in).  \n\nMy husband was anxious to watch the Bears game so he found a spot in the cozy waiting area with a big screen TV.  Bobbie offered to check us in early and I asked about our accommation request to be near the elevator or an area that would require very little walking.  It appeared that he may have had a challenge with our request.\n\nI explained the huge inconvenience with our last visit.  The lady that checked us in, sent us to one of the farthest rooms along the zig zag cooridor.  AFTER we requested a room that required very little walking (due to traveling with a family member on oxygen) and THAT was the best they could do for us?  My husband was exhausted before he was half way to the room.  Needless to say, he didn't want me to request a \"closer\" room after that.  This is why I give them my request when I book the room.\n\nFortunately for all of us, the extra planning helped. An extra bonus was that Bobbie ask if I was Priority Club Rewards member.  Well I wasn't, but I planned on asking...and of course it slipped my mind.  Thankfully, because Bobbie asked me about it, I am now a Priority Club member! This is great because we will be coming here a few times a year.  Bobbie was really good about explaining the details of the membership and even let me know how I can get extra points online.\n\nDid I say how great Bobbie was?  Well...he was everywhere!  He hand-delivered our new membership information to our room (with chocolate and a beverage). Whenever he saw me in the lobby, he always asked if there was anything I needed.  He also helped out with the breakfast buffet in the morning.  He literaly was everywhere!  It's not like he was leaning on the counter when I saw him.  No, he was very proactive in genuinely making his guests feel comfortable.  He's definitely a keeper.  \n\nWhenever I'm in the Madison area, I will continue to book at this Staybridge because of my experience and the excellent service that Bobbie provided.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rKNtd_M2kWDW8sQKYzetKA"}

Earlier this year, I had a one-bedroom suite for almost three months.  A family member was in the hospital at UW-Madison during this time and this hotel was more than accommodating for the specific needs in our situation.\n\nI'm not going to go into the specific details of the accommodations partly to protect individual privacy.  The other reason not to get so detailed is simply because I think the staff went so far out of their way that these \"favors\" may potentially be abused by other guests if they were aware of the extreme kindness.  \n\nAs I mentioned, this hotel offered many special accommodations.  This allowed us to truly  feel like we had a \"home away from home\".  Most of the staff knew me by name.  They were sensitive to the fact that I had a loved one who was in the hospital and critically ill. I wasn't alone in this, though.  There were many other guests in a similar (if not same) situation as me.  This hotel could be a pilot for partnering up with hospitals in a win, win, win scenario that benefits the hotel, hospital, and the guest/patient.  In addition, I would not be surprised if they have special training for their staff in the area of customer service and handling special accommodations.  \n\nThe manager, Brad, is visible and on-site on a regular basis.  He and his staff organize and manage a social for their guests three nights a week.  The social offers a free meal and drinks (including beer and wine) for a couple hours in the evening. And, as the name describes, it allows their guests an excellent opportunity to socialize.  \n\nThere are several hotel options recommended by UW and we tried three of them.  This one may be five miles away from the main UW hospital, but it is a straight shot along University Avenue.  Now that UW purchased the Best Western Intowner, there is much more of a push with them recommending their newly owned property to UW patients.  The Intowner is fine, but the best thing going for it is how close it is to the hospital. The Staybridge-Middleton, outshines them in so may ways - indoor pool, hot tub, laundry facility, garage, large suites, kitchenettes, socials, breakfast buffet,and most of all...the staff.\n\nUnfortunately, I can not remember all the names of the staff that I would love to thank.  Our housekeeper was perfect.  She cleaned only when we needed it and got to know our preferences.  For instance, she asked if we could use an extra box of Kleenex because she remembered us requesting an extra box the week before.  She always did a great job cleaning and freshening up our room and never invaded our space. \n\nI noticed how well the staff work together as a team and support each other when the need arises.  It's obvious that the staff members are cross-trained to manage various work areas and different shifts.  For instance, I first met Bonnie on the shuttle.  She arrived at UW Hospital to pick me up.  She even showed me a quicker route back to the hotel during rush hour.  During my stay, I also saw Bonnie at the front desk, at the breakfast buffet, in the kitchen area, in the dining area, managing the socials, and even came to our suite to fix the television!  It turned out that the remote needed new batteries - which she was prepared for.\n\nI also feel like I got to know Ana pretty well since she worked the breakfast buffet many mornings.  Between her and Bonnie, I just don't know how they always seem to make everything run so smoothly.  \n\nThere is another lady with short blonde hair (sorry, I can't seem to remember her name)  that always worked the socials.  She was so welcoming and learned what I like to eat and drink.  She even encouraged me to take food \"to-go\"  when I needed to rush back to the hospital.  It was like being with family.\n\nJan, Justin and Bobby are always a pleasure at the front desk.  Not only are they welcoming, but they go out their way to get answers to your questions and take care of any requests.  \n\nMy final comments are definitely not the least important.  During my stay, I noticed that there was a team of about three housekeeping staff members who appeared to have cognitive/mental disabilities.  I was so pleased to see this and know that this hotel and the manager recognize the need to utilize talents that are so often overlooked. There may have been moments of inconvenience for the guests or perhaps mistakes made by these staff members.  However, this is how they learn and become an integral part of society.  I commend Brad Cook for making diversity a priority.\n\nUntil my next stay...", "type": "review", "business_id": "rKNtd_M2kWDW8sQKYzetKA"}

It was very obvious I was there waiting, and very obvious that she was just wasting time. Meanwhile, her and one of the other employees started to argue with one another, all the while she does nothing. Finally, I tried to make eye contact with one of them, because I really was in a hurry to get back to Milwaukee. Finally, she made my drink, slooooooowly. \n\nAs an aside, I'm not that uptight or fast-paced of a person, but customer service with no customer focus really gets on my nerves, and there is simply no excuse for ignoring a customer in a coffee shop at 7:30 in the morning. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1-EIdeHewfEVcpoZm38N8A"}

Perhaps get a fortified coffee drink, (as in with some special ingrediants) Daddy Grasshopper, Irish Coffee, etc... they make them up right.\nE. If you have to pass D. there are still plenty of good options for coffee & tea drinkers.\nF. Not as many food options at this location but they do have cookies, scones, bagels, etc..\nG.

I really liked the scones, but I didn't like the fact that they didn't open until 7 which usually made me a bit late.  I didn't even consider that they might have more than bakery goods, and every time I had stopped the place seemed empty.  This was of course due to the fact that it was 7:01 AM and I was the first person through the door.  So this weekend, based on Chris & Kelly's recommendations, I stopped in for a nice leisurely breakfast before heading into the office.  I found out that all this time I was seriously overlooking a great place right in my neighborhood.\n\nI was a bit taken aback by the number of people inside.  The place was pleasantly crowded, with the warm buzz of morning conversations and a relaxed atmosphere.  I walked up and ordered the breakfast special - I was used to just picking out scones so it took me a minute to get my bearings and find the menu board.  The price was OK, not under $6 but not more than I would have expected anywhere else.  I was given a number and found a nice table along the bookshelves.  I'd never really taken the time to look around the place before, and I was really impressed by the decor.  I got a cup of coffee from the self-service area, which is a great idea - I love diners where your cup is constantly refilled but I tend to keep drinking so long as there's coffee in the cup, leading to the over-caffienated jitters.  The coffee was excellent, truly delicious and fair trade to boot.  I savored it while I read a magazine and waited on my breakfast.\n\nAfter a bit of a wait the breakfast special came out.  The wait wasn't especially long considering the amount of people there, but I was into my second cup of coffee by the time my food came.  It was served on a fairly large plate, so my first impression was that there was not much to it, but this was a mistake.  The special, which was basically a Denver scrambler, was completely satisfying, filling but not heavy.  The wheat toast was much better than the average bread you get with breakfast, quite possibly highlight of the food.  I was pleasantly surprised by the whole breakfast experience here.  I wasn't planning on finding such a great place for breakfast in the Prairie Cafe.

It's largely a \"self-service\" type place, which is fine by me.  You place your order at the main counter, get your own coffee and condiments, find a table and wait for the food to arrive.  When you're done eating, you clear your own table, take the dishes to the \"dish basket\" and head on your merry way.\n\nThe pancakes aren't anything spectacular - just your regular \"mix made\" pancakes.  They're cooked well, with nice color, and are \"plate size\" so one or two should be plenty for most folks.  They're not obscenely thick; in fact, they're a bit on the thin side, come to think of it.\n\nBreakfast sandwich is decent - an egg, your choice of meat, some cheese, and served on a muffin.\n\nI've also had the Wright Breakfast and today, I had the special, which was two eggs, scrambled with tomatoes, peppers, onion, ham, cheese and a choice of toast.  Again - it was good, but not \"out of this world great.\"\n\nThey're currently serving Alterra-brand coffee; another review references Ancora, but it looks like they've switched to Alterra.  It's good coffee, nonetheless.\n\nStaff keeps largely to themselves, which is nice - no one bothers you throughout the meal.  They don't take credit/debit cards - it's cash or check only.  There's a fair amount of seating indoors and a few metal tables and chairs outside for when the weather is nice.  There tends to be a lot of families that meet here on the weekends, so if kids aren't your thing, steer clear on Saturday and Sunday.  I had the joy of listening to two screaming kids during my entire meal this morning - the parents were oblivious... \n\nMy biggest gripe?  Price.  My breakfast this morning (\"special\" plus two pancakes plus coffee) cost $14.10.  That's a little steep for standard breakfast fare...\n\nBreakfast is served all-day long on Saturday and Sunday; during the week it's served until 11am, at which point it's lunch only until closing time (around 3pm, I believe).", "type": "review", "business_id": "ShEYKerTwb2LSORE5o_s7A"}

I was particularly blown away by the chocolate croissant, which I couldn't imagine could trump my favorite at Bennison's in Evanston IL but it was deliciously buttery, flakey and had the best chocolate filling I've ever had in pain chocolat! My husband swore that his mocha was the best he's had in his life. Kind of makes us want to move out here!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ShEYKerTwb2LSORE5o_s7A"}

The food is expensive (~$12 for two eggs, toast, bacon, coffee) and the coffee isn't great, but the atmosphere is nice and I didn't come all that often so it seemed like sort of a luxury. The staff also isn't particularly outgoing, though not downright rude... until today. \n\nToday is Sunday, and I arrived around 8am. I usually try to get there kind of early and leave before it gets busy so I'm not taking up a table. I bought a big breakfast (as described above) and sat down to work. Just over an hour later, I was approached by a middle-aged man whom I assume is the owner or manager but whom I've never seen before. He asked if I was aware of their \"new policy\" about Wi-Fi on Sunday mornings, and how they don't want people just hanging out using the internet when it gets crowded. (No sugar coating, that's almost verbatim what he said.) For the record, I wasn't actually using their wi-fi, I was writing. Whatever. His point was obvious. I stared at him for a few seconds because I couldn't believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when I had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate. He suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded I should get out. I said that if that's how they felt I would leave now, and he responded, \"That's exactly how we feel.\" I was shocked, and still am. I have never, NEVER been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business. And I'm a regular, paying customer!! I always leave a tip! I still can't believe I was treated this way.\n\nI will no longer recommend this place, now that they've shown their true colors. If the food was exceptional I might try to swallow my pride, but it's really nothing special. There are several other breakfast/coffee shops in the area (including a Starbucks across the road) and I will be patronizing them instead from now on.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ShEYKerTwb2LSORE5o_s7A"}

One chicken breast is plenty for me. \n\nDespite being inexpensive, the chicken is fairly good quality - I've never had any gross bits (like the weird slimy string you find in chicken tenders at a lot of places). Occasionally the rice is on the dry side, but that's why man invented sauce.\n\nThough 9 times out of 10 I opt for the Smiling Lotus Plate (with lemon sauce & white rice, if you're wondering), occasionally I'll get the Sesame Chicken. Lots of chicken, plenty of rice, two meals easy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KW6HejC-67KSL9J8Cz1dSw"}

My first indication that I was not in Peking, was the Hispanic girl struggling to understand my English ordering and the POS system which was also in English. Damn oppressive society.\n\nAnyway, I really should not disparage global initiative the restaurant is embracing. We are all going to be working for Indian companies, as Obama went specifically to India to procure 15 million jobs to alleviate the unemployment crisis in this country.

Almost thought I was in Los Angeles again.\n\nThe cream cheese puffs were soggy, greasy and about as far from \"puffy\" as one could get. The chicken was white, but it was also fatty and grisly.\nThe Thai spring rolls were not bad flavor but they too were greasy and not very crispy. The fried rice was disgusting, just a greasy mush of dirty looking rice, mushrooms and egg. Finally, the pot stickers, ah the pot stickers, they should have stuck to the pot. The filling was some processed mash of something, while the outside was supposed to have been lightly pan fried, let's emphasize the word \"lightly.\"\n\nThis is not very good Asian food. I would suggest that there must be a better choice in Madison. I am sure there are Asians in Madison. I have not seen them, but somewhere in this land must lay a pocket of Asians.

I've never dined in, so I won't comment on atmosphere.\n\nTheir menu and nutritional info is easily accessed on line. \n\nFor the most part, I've had OK experiences with the food selections. I don't expect spectacular food from this place, it is, after all, 'Fast Food' from a restaurant chain. It's nothing really special. \n\nHowever, today I had an experience that sort of turned my stomach a bit. I ordered a Shrimp and Veggie Stir fry to go. When I got back to work and went to dig in, I was a little disgusted to find that the shrimp were not deveined prior to cooking. For those of you who don't know what that means: The Shrimp's digestive track (seen as a dark brown 'vein' along the spine of the shrimp) wasn't removed, which means that the digestive track and it's contents were left in place. Yes, I know it's not horrible to eat it, but if you know what it is, it can turn your stomach. I assumed that a restaurant such as this would devein shrimp prior to cooking. \n\nI pulled all the shrimp and deveined them myself, but I'd already lost my appetite. I did put the shrimp aside and ate some of the brown rice and veggies, but with my stomach already feeling a bit nauseous, that didn't go well. So now I'm left with an $8 meal sitting on my desk (soon to hit the garbage) with only about 1/8th of it consumed and having to find an alternative for lunch. \n\nLesson learned, if I'm craving a good stir fry with shrimp, shell out the extra cash for PF Changs.\n\n**** I thought eventually I'd go back, but I haven't been since then. We had some of their food catered in for work, it was overcooked, rubbery, and chewy. yeah, next time I'll get my own lunch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KW6HejC-67KSL9J8Cz1dSw"}

I require a side dish of epinephrine if I eat crab, so I appreciate this omission. Now that I have established that I go here just for the cream cheese puffs, it should be clear that I'm far from an expert on Asian food. So take the rest of my review with a grain of salt; there should be plenty to spare in your entree. \n\nI used to think this place was ok -- it still has plenty of variety, a very friendly staff, good chili-garlic sauce, decent potstickers, above-average lettuce wraps, no grisly or fatty pieces of meat -- but lately the preparation has been sloppy and the presentation just as bad. I suspect the quality of the ingredients has come down a notch. \n\nAfter cream cheese wontons, Pad Thai is one of my favorite Asian entrees. My last order looked like Goldilocks's porridge in the \"Three Little Bears\" Golden Book I had as a kid. Dull gray, soupy, greasy, salty and watery, yet somehow sticky. The chopped peanuts added no crunch at all, which is too bad because other than the chicken pieces I picked through the mess to find, I was hoping to find something else edible. Epic fail on this entree. \n\nOn my next visit, I ordered the Firecracker noodles with chicken, as a side to my beloved wontons. Slight improvement from last time but still salty as the Dead Sea and enough grease to de-squeak every door hinge on the west side. The bag was so heavy I skipped my biceps workout for a week. The red peppers had no life left. Again, I hunted and pecked for the chicken, which is consistently decent-quality, well-prepared white meat. My wife's veggie fried rice would have been ok -- they ease up on the salt and Valvoline for this entree -- but the vegetables were overcooked and charred in places. Fresh veggies should present as a bright spectrum of colors -- orange from the carrots, bright green from the scallions, broccoli and pea pods, yellow from the corncobettes. Instead, however, they were the same brown color as the fried rice. \n\nMy last fortune cookie said I'll probably return to Chin's. It's on the way home from work, the food comes out fast and I can't resist those damn cream cheese wontons. Maybe I'll throw in some potstickers or wraps and call it dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KW6HejC-67KSL9J8Cz1dSw"}

I have seen the same people working here for a while now and they always make me feel so welcome. They are usually a couple of early 30's to middle aged women working here that make ya feel like mom is welcoming you home. \"What can I get ya hun,\" \"How's your day going sweety,\" that kind of stuff. And some people may not like that but I enjoy it because it makes you feel way more comfortable to be somewhere. They are always fast and efficient and any extras you may want are stocked plentifully. The one small thing I don't like is that they are tucked away and really have to be looking for it to know where it is and it is sort of a small building. It can get really cramped if there is a line in there and pushed against some of the valuables.

Day one, while handing a venti coffee to a patron, the barrista was handing the coffee while securing the lid, which resulted in the coffee tipping over and hitting four people.  While cleaning up, I mentioned that coffee was still under the counter and you would have thought that I told the barrista he was completely inadequate.  I would just hate for someone to lean on the counter and get residual hanging coffee.  \n\nDay two - They ran out of something.  Not sure what.  But something.  I know this because they were all milling around talking crap about someone who was not doing their job.  The funny part is that no one was attending to the people in front of the counter.

For a while, it was the next great thing - there always were long lines of families anxious to get their butterfat and sugar fix.  The buzz has faded and now those same families flock to the local froyo joints to get their frozen dairy fix.  I stopped by this weekend while shopping at Greenway Station and found the store devoid of patrons.  I know it's been a long, cold winter, but we Wisconsinites love our ice cream and Babcock Hall was standing room only when I visited later that same day.\n\nSo why does my ice-creaming loving family now generally eschew Cold Stone?\n* Texture - I really prefer a firm scoop of ice cream and that's not what you get at Cold Stone.  The texture is far too gooey for my liking.  It's not terrible, but I much prefer the denser texture of the product at Babcock Dairy or The Chocolate Shoppe any day of the week and twice on Sunday.  The other textural problem is that Cold Stone ice cream melts too fast, so bring a gross of handi-wipes when bringing the kiddos here. \n \n* Flavor - The ice cream here is too sweet.  At Cold Stone, it is all about excess, whether it be about the butterfat content, the sugar content or the oversaturated flavorings.  Again, it's not terrible, but it's just not my cup of tea.\n\n* Serving Size - The theme of excess carries over to the over-the-top serving sizes.  While I am not a huge fan of froyo, at least I can control my serving size when I visit the near-by Menchies or Orange Leaf.  In addition, while I'm on the topic of serving sizes, can I just add that I detest the cutesy \"Like It\", \"Love It\" and \"Gotta Have It\" serving size names.\n\n* Service - When the place first opened, the staff was energetic and responsive.  I admit it was hokey, but I kinda liked the dorky songs they sang when you left a tip.  But now, a trip to Cold Stone is more like visiting a gulag.  Leaving a tip rarely triggers a response, much less a chorus of \"Ice cream, baby\" sung to the tune of Ice, Ice Baby.  My other pet peeve is that the tables always seem to be sticky, thanks to the soupiness of the ice cream.  It's really kind of a depressing place to visit now.\n\n* Pro tip: If you have a peanut allergy, have them clean the stone before they mix your ice cream or you risk cross contaminating your treat.  (I learned that the hard way.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "AYoLKzRFajucKnjIFxc__A"}

At its worst it is the epitome of a townie joint.  I've seen both over the last five years.  When I first visited the Boar it was a dive.  My college roommate had a job tending bar and we would from time to time take up his offer of free drinks in return for keeping him company.  The barstools were often filled with the usual regulars, drinking under a thick pall of smoke.  There is a certain charm to dive bars and I'm sure for some the old Boar had it, but not for me.  \n\nFortunately the owner completed renovated the entire bar, and this happened right about the time I moved out to MIddleton.  In place of the dingy walls was stylish wood paneling and tile floors instead of linoleum.  The ceilings were raised and the ventilation was improved, and while it can certainly still get smoky my eyes don't burn anymore.  There is a sand volleyball court out back and bar leagues during the summer.  The jukebox is relatively standard, but there are a few gems tucked in amidst the usual country & hard rock options.  The regular crowd is still around, but a good deal more young people can be found at the Boar these days.  Some nights are vibrant and fun, some not so much.  I can't say that I've tried much of the food.  I know from my old roommate that there is a small grill in back, which was added during the renovation.  The Emil's pizzas are good as always.  All in all the new Boar is a complete improvement over the old one.\n\nThere are still a few things that keep the Boar from being my favorite in Middleton, namely the tap selection.  I am a beer snob and proud of it, so when the only local tap option is Spotted Cow I call foul.  I can't think of another Middleton bar that doesn't have at least one Capital tap, or at least Esser's Best.  What really seals it for me is sometimes the Spotted lines aren't even clean and the beer comes out flat and a bit funky.  Another complaint that I frequently have is some of the bartenders know next to nothing about proper drink mixing.  It is usually the same bartenders that act put upon to even mix a drink as opposed to just grabbing a bottle.  Some of the older bartenders are very good, but you almost have to know the schedule to avoid the others.", "type": "review", "business_id": "c5awCF5eu0ZkxUf_i94uPA"}

The race began Friday, so we arrived late Thursday afternoon and left in the morning.\n\nReservations were made months in advance and were honored when we got there. Check-in was simple and the employees seemed to enjoy our enthusiasm and joking around. They even welcomed us with fresh cookies. How can you hate on a hotel with cookies? You just can't.\n\nThe location, strangely enough, was both ideal and not. The nice thing was that we were close enough to the starting line that it wasn't a huge issue for our first group of runners to leave at 5am and get there on time; however, being somewhat closer to where the race started might have been nicer and we're looking into that for 2013, because it was a bit of a haul for the second van (my van).\n\nOn the other hand, we were far enough away that this hotel did not fill up immediately and it had no problem blocking off some rooms for us and we were right off the highway, very close to restaurants for an easy group dinner and there is a shopping center right next door. I took full advantage of stocking up on anything I might have missed by going to the local Erehwon and running shop. That was incredibly convenient. They also have a really good continental breakfast.\n\nAs far as the hotel room: the beds were incredibly comfortable but the shower drain was backed up. I ended up in a couple inches of dirty water, which is never fun. However, I had some of the best sleep of my life.

The decor is indeed cozy- like a nicely made-up cellar.  There was plenty of room at the bar so we sat there before our reservation time arrived.  Only two beers on tap, but both good local brews from Capital. \nEventually sat at our table & perused the menu.  Found many appetizers that sounded really good (including one of the specials that night) so we decided on sharing 2 apps and one entree... seemed like a good way to try a few items without getting too much food.\nApp #1 (the special): gnocchi in a savory cream sauce with crawfish was very tasty.  Seemed a bit light in the gnocchi (I think there were 5 or 6) but made up for it in sauce.  Two thumbs way up.\nApp #2: mussels in cream sauce... I had asked about the size of the mussels ahead of time and was told they were medium to large.  They were in fact medium to small, which was a bit of a bummer because we probably would have gone with a different app had we known.  But the flavors were good & we enjoyed sopping up the sauce with the bread.  And the bread they serve is quite good.  Two thumbs up.\nEntree: Crawfish Etouffe... I was excited to try this as I hadn't had etouffe in years.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  If you went to a friend's house for dinner and they served this you'd be psyched, but at an upscale Cajun restaurant for $20 you may be left underwhelmed.  Two thumbs halfway up.  The salad that came with was fresh mesclun greens, with a bleu cheese dressing that was chunky but bland.\nMidway thru our meal the jazz combo started up and sounded really good- definitely added to the atmosphere.  For dessert we shared a slice of key lime pie... nice-tasting but no great shakes.  It seemed to be thickened with gelatin and I suppose I prefer mine to be creamier, plus it was lacking in zing, but only mildly.  Again, if your friend served it you'd rightfully congratulate them but for $6.50 it should be REALLY good.\nOur server was very nice & professional.  Absolutely no complaints there.\nThe nicest surprise came with the bill- only $70... and that included 5 drinks.\nWe have concluded that the next time we go we'll sit in the bar area and have drinks & apps.", "type": "review", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA"}

Ok. Just had to get that off my chest. The dressing surprised me and I'll go back for more than just that. \n\nWe arrived on a Saturday night without a reservation.  I believe we took one of the last tables available until 9 or so. I would have opted for the bar if a table hadn't been available. There are a few high top tables that are seated in an area with live music.  The place is small and intimate. It's the perfect place for a first date. \n\nWe started with the Lemon Parmesan Artichoke Hearts which were nothing like I expected but were rich and flavorful. We weren't terribly hungry so I ordered and appetizer for my entr\u00e9e and my boyfriend ordered the special. I tried the Crawfish Cheesecake, which, is basically a cheese ball in the shape of a piece of cheesecake. It was tasty and would make the perfect appetizer for a table of four but I wouldn't recommended as a main entr\u00e9e.\n\nThe special was the highlight of the meal. I couldn't repeat it if my life depended on it, but I heard the words: scallops, shrimp and sweet potato  ravioli, pecans, lime something and zucchini... I forgot about the rest of the menu entirely.  I'm not doing the plate any justice with this, but please trust me, it was delicious. The vegetables were perfectly cooked with a lime (something, slightly spicy but still let the veggies shine) sauce that complimented the sweet potato ravioli. Then there were scallops. It was one of those dishes that I couldn't comprehend. All I know is I am anxious to try more of what this chef has to offer.", "type": "review", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA"}

We had the artichoke hearts, crab puffs, and escargots for appetizers.  I didn't get the sense that the seafood was fresh.  Rather it was definitely of the frozen variety.  And everything was made with frozen puff pastry.  Even the escargot were covered with puff pastry. I think it was to cover for the frozen seafood?  Anyway, the appetizers reminded me of Pinterest recipes.  \n\nA big red flag for me is when there are too many components in a dish.  That usually means that the ingredients aren't good enough to stand out on their own or the chef doesn't know how to edit.  I think we experienced a little of both.  \n\nMy husband and I both got the special. It was a blackened pork tenderloin with shrimp accompanied by mushrooms in a sherry sauce with red potatoes.  Each component sounded good.  However, the presentation and preparation was a train wreck.  \n\nThe tenderloin came on skewers.  What?  The shrimp were over cooked.  The meat and shrimp were served in a jumble of quartered red potatoes and mushrooms.  Everything was covered in some sort of Cajun seasoning that was reminiscent of Durkee or McCormick.  Then it was all topped with some sort of cornstarch thickened sherry sauce.  The whole thing tasted like it was straight off the Sysco truck  and reheated. \n\nOne of our companions ordered the filet.  She let us have a taste, and the steak was good.  But it came with a buerre blanc dipping sauce.  I'm not sure what chef would pair buerre blanc with steak to begin with, but just like my meal, it was clear that the buerre blanc was another corn starch imposter.  \n\nDessert was a dark chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  It was dry and pedestrian.  \n\nReally I think this place deserves 2.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't do half stars, so I'll be generous.  Lousiannes clearly has a loyal customer base and is a popular place.  I would definitely go back for the cocktails and even the appetizers because the price point wasn't outrageous for all the puff pastry and I could still enjoy them now that I know what to expect.  \n\nBut I would not return for dinner.  If I'm going to spend $30 for an entree, I expect fresh ingredients, sauces made to order, and a chef that knows how to cook.  Madison has too many restaurants that offer far superior food to Lousiannes, and that's what will drive my future dining decisions.", "type": "review", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA"}

Having never been to Louisianne's in the 5 years that I've lived in Middleton, I suggested we try it out.\n\nI give the atmosphere of this place a solid five stars. Although it has an rather bland looking storefront, the inside of the restaurant is anything but. You walk into Louisianne's and immediately head downstairs. It's all stone and looks like you're walking into a cool cave or something. It's dark, but there's a lot of ambiance. I've been to New Orleans, and it definitely has that sort of vibe to it. It's romantic, fun, and not what you'd expect from the outside. I felt like we were on vacation while we were there. Also, there was a live jazz band playing and they were really rocking. It was awesome!\n\nWe went at about 8pm on a Friday night had to wait about ten minutes for a table, which was fine. While we waited, we ordered drinks at the bar and watched the band. I had red wine, and my husband had Jameson on the rocks. \n\nWe were seated and ordered the Pecan Crab Cakes as an appetizer. They were good, probably just 3 stars though, as they tasted a lot like other Midwestern crab cakes that I've had before. They were heavy on bread and light on crab...with a lot of Old Bay seasoning. Again, they weren't bad at all, but not spectacular.\n\nNext, we ordered some more wine and our entrees (more on those in a minute).  We were given a choice of soup or salad with our entrees and we each ordered soup. They had two soups of the day: a shrimp -corn chowder (which I got), and a tomato-based pulled pork stew that was like chilli (which my husband had). Both soups were fantastic! Definitely 5 stars for the soup. \n\nI'll take a minute here to comment that I enjoy going to traditional restaurants from time to time, places where soup/salad and bread are included with your meal instead of everything being ala-cart. (It reminds me of dining in Wisconsin supper clubs as a child). By the way, the bread basket was delicious and was quickly replenished by the waitress after we ate all of the bread within 30 seconds of sitting down because it was warm and toasty (and served with soft butter) and we were starving! \n\nOnto the entrees! My husband absolutely LOVED his dish. He claims that it was possibly \"the best thing I've ever had in a restaurant\". He chose the Coffee Roasted Chicken, which featured a bed of (homemade) fettuccine topped with a coffee-crusted bone-in grilled chicken breast, in a \"hazelnut, orange, ricotta sauce\". I think there was spinach in it too. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the grilled chicken moist, and the sauce was rich and creamy. It almost reminded me of a Thai peanut sauce, but with hazelnuts instead. Although it sounded like something that could become cloyingly sweet, it was not. It had a nice subtle umami essence in addition to the sweetness. Delicious. 5 stars.\n\nThe reason that Louisianne's is not getting a five star review from me, however, is due to my entree, which I felt was very underwhelming. We don't eat pasta at home for health reasons, so I usually get it when we go somewhere nice as a special treat. I chose the tasso and shrimp fettuccine because it was homemade pasta, and because it featured authentic New Orleans style ingredients (for the unfamiliar, tasso is basically spicy ham). The shrimp and tasso pieces in my pasta were well-cooked, but they were sparse. The dish also featured mushrooms, and they were fabulous...probably the best part. However, the pasta was supposed to have a \"Creole mustard cream sauce\", and it didn't really. The sauce was very light, and had little flavor. It was kind of sad, because I was really hoping to be wowed and I wasn't. I'd say my item was probably 3 stars, and would have been awesome if only the sauce had been a bit more pronounced and flavorful. \n\nThe service was adequate. Nothing remarkable in either a good or a bad way.\n\nSummary: I'd definitely return. I think Lousianne's Etc. is a decently nice restaurant overall, and is great for special occasions. Their primary issue, from both my own experience as well as the reviews on Yelp, seems to be consistency. Some menu items are fabulous, and others are meh. The major problem with this is that Louisianne's  menu is at a price point where people only go occasionally...so the restaurant basically has one shot to impress, and if they fail at that, guests won't return for a second chance. I think this explains why the Yelp reviews for Louisianne's are so polarized.", "type": "review", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA"}

I thought initially it was going to be an amazing hotel, since I totally screwed up on the reservation (made it for the wrong day) and the girl at the desk was so cool to work with me and get me a room when the whole place was fully booked.  \n\nExcept, the place was fully booked for the \"Little Miss Junior Miss\" Pageant, or some other stupid name like that, which meant HELL for Andy and I as the entire place was infested with pre-teen beauty queens, their scary domineering mothers, and other random siblings that came along for the ride.  Can you say O. M. G.  \n\nNow, normally this would be a non-issue, as we are rarely in our hotel room except to sleep and once in the room you couldnt hear a lot of hallway noise.  But this 10 story hotel had a grand total of 2 elevators, which were packed at all hours of the day with girls in gowns and tiaras, groups of girls in heavy makeup, or wet children dripping from the hotel pool. This made getting in and out a bit challenging since we were on the top floor. \n\nI realize this is hardly Marriotts fault that the Junior Misses had descended upon Middleton, since they are just trying to turn a buck in this economy, but the design of this place was not user friendly in the slightest.  Also, hey brilliant idea guys, put the pool across the hall from the elevator and then make that whole area tile so people track water out and the floor is slippery!  Nice.  And also understaff the dining area so noone can get in and eat because there is noone to clean off the tables and take your order.  Nice planning!\n\nMan, that whole experience left a bad taste.  The worst part will be trying to convince Andy to stay at a Marriott ever again as he is just now getting relief from the migrane he got on Saturday.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA"}

It would have been an easy, quick jaunt out the front door with it.\n- The 20min it took to get extra towels\n- The empty ice bin in the vending area\n- The desk clerk who came out to talk to customers while still chewing food\n\nBy far the worst offense was the fact that check-out time was noon, yet housekeeping tried to enter our room at EIGHT IN THE MORNING. I can't imagine it's that hard to find out which rooms are ready for cleaning, and which are not. \n\nThe only real pro was the bedding, which was luxe and fluffy. Not even close to being worth the $2800 they sell it for, but fun for a night. \n\nThe room ended up being cheap for the name-brand, but more satisfaction could have been found from a lesser-name place.

So we messed with it... nada.  So we changed rooms, not a big deal.  We went right next door.  That room was the same as the last.  Downsides to this room though, the phone was dirty... I knew this cause the phone was tan/beige colored.  It was yucky.  Also, the tub liner in the first room was filthy.  Another thing I wish this hotel would change is installing fans in the bathrooms!  My boyfriend also pointed out that the sheets on the bed were super starched.   If you moved it sounded like sandpaper on sandpaper.  Madness.  I did have a odd triangle shaped hole in the sheets on my side of the bed...so that was less than plesant too.  Oh ,also the hot tub was down for maintence when we were there :( Bummer.  But the pool was open and no one was in it.

Airport hotels tend to be very outdated and there is typically little incentive to do a renovation because the hotel has a steady stream of customers due to its proximity to the airport and convenience of airport shuttle transportation.  This Marriott has a similar look as the Philadelphia Airport Renaissance.  Both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up 9 to 12 levels high.  You do get a nice look onto the open atrium as you ascend on the quick glass elevators at this property.\n\nUnfortunately, this hotel is very out-of-date.  The lobby and cafe looks like something from the early to mid-80s.  The rooms are a little more contemporary though parts very dated; at the kitchenette sink, there was a bottom cabinet that may have been a dishwasher at one time; instead, it was empty with lots of dust and exposed piping (not nice to find at any hotel).\n\nThe breakfast buffet did not inspire freshness either.  The food quality was not horrible, but a lot of the food was quite salty.  Food options included bacon, sausage, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, continental breakfast options, and an omelet bar.  In addition, the poor lighting in the lobby and throughout the hotel made the food and other stuff maybe feel worse than they actually were.\n\nThis Marriott is still a comfortable place to stay and has good customer service.  The rooms are comfortable with good beds and linen.  The room temperature was fine though the unit did not seem to consistently keep the room cool.  The shower was fine.\n\nThis Marriott has many suites so you have a good shot of getting upgraded if you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member.  The suites are spacious and the bedroom is separated from the living room area with a door.  Their suites are outfitted with a mini fridge, kitchen sink (as mentioned) and a microwave.\n\nOn weekends, Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members get an offer of full breakfast buffet for two per Saturday and Sunday or 750 Marriott Rewards points per Saturday and Sunday.  This is a new nationwide Marriott benefit for Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members and the hotel is only obligated to offer a continental breakfast.  I have been to a few properties (Santa Clara Marriott, Minneapolis Marriott City Center) that are only doing the bare minimum--continental breakfast--so this Marriott is definitely going above and beyond in this area (though the quality of the full breakfast buffet, as already mentioned, was not that great).\n\nThe front desk was nice and helpful.\n\nRoom rates are good, but this hotel is not in Downtown Madison.  It is only a 7 to 10 minute drive to Madison though.  However, I am not sure if getting to Downtown Madison on a Wisconsin football game day is challenging.\n\nThis Marriott would not be a good property for a long stay.  This hotel just does not feel fresh enough.  It is a comfortable enough spot for a short stay though due to their comfortable rooms and good service.  If you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member, they do treat you well here and maybe even better than some Marriott properties.\n\nThis Marriott has its own free parking lot.  It is easy finding an open space.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA"}

The toilet handle was misbehaving and while it took some time for engineering to fix it, they were beyond apologetic and did all of the things you'd expect a good hotel to do - either offer a room change/upgrade or other free stuff. The hotel is in Middleton so don't book a room here and then complain that it's not downtown. Look at a map. How is it the hotel's fault that you are in need of additional IQ points? \n\nSo many Yelpers like to complain about every dumb, little thing without understanding that it's not about perfection, it's about how a business responds to a problem.

There is part of me that wants to go a little lower, but the management on a couple occasions and the general kindness of the concierge lounge attendants made up an extra star. \n\nThis Marriott is about the level of a nicer Courtyard Marriott. The ONLY way our stay was bearable was because we were upgraded to suite. If we had not had the door to separate our bedroom from living space, we would have been unable to rest with all of the noise coming up from the atrium..and we were on the 9th floor. A cocktail reception on a Tuesday night in the vast open space of the lobby was incredibly loud, but no problem due to our suite.   However a gathering of incredibly loud, rude teenagers whose director used a BULLHORN at 9pm at night to address the entire hotel of teenagers was the last straw for us. We had a two week reservation...we left 5 nights in.  \n\nAdditional issues with this property: the concierge lounge is very, very limited. Every other Marriott (including most Courtyards) have coffee and tea in the lounge throughout the day, not to mention during the cocktail/dessert hours. At this one, there is none during the day, and, most frustrating, in the evening you have to ask the concierge to provide you with a cup of coffee or hot water. Not at all convenient for a business traveller who takes calls in the lounge. Plus the coffee is not high quality. The attendants were very kind, but just not a well executed lounge in comparison to other properties.\n\nI also want to thank the management who alerted housekeeping when we were leaving in the morning to service our room for the last couple days we were there. Prior to that, the room was not being serviced until about 2:30pm, which is our daughters naptime, and she was along with us on this trip. It was a little frustrating.  As for the ACTUAL service, it was hit or miss. One day was great, replenished our towels, toiletries, took out the trash. Another time our daughters blankets were thrown into a ball in the corner of the bedroom, zero toiletries replenished, and two of her toys that were drying in the bathroom were thrown away. A call for extra towels went without towels ever materializing one night.  Also, the in-room fridge does not fully work, and our hummus, juices, and other snacks were spoiled. \n\nI get that this is the area's biggest conference center, so maintaining business is not a problem for them. However, for those of us who travel frequently and experience many Marriott properties, this one does not come up to scratch, but again, the friendly demeanor of most employees we encountered did help the spotty service of this hotel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA"}

I ordered a sandwich for lunch and it was a bit \"buttery.\"  I do like that you can order your food ahead of time and have it ready at a particular time.  \n\nThe rooms are very typical.  Nothing outstanding, but it is nice to have a window to look at something besides a brick wall.  You get a parking lot view but you get motion.  \n\nThe banquet rooms were gorgeous.  The hotel is nicely decorated.  It even has a small waterfall hiding the elevators.  I was annoyed by the parking situation.  It is downhill.  Not a huge hill, but enough to make the walk precarious during these icy times.  Perhaps a little more salt could be expended for visitors.  The location is nice as it is near restaurant and a mall.  Forget something at home?  There is even a costco within ten minutes driving.  It is about 1/4 mile off the beltline and just outside of Madison (by one highway exit).  \n\nIf you want to stay in Madison but avoid the high prices of downtown and the congestion of rush hour, this is the place to be.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA"}

I recently attended an evening Board meeting and a one-day conference at this hotel.\n\nThe majority of the sales and catering staff at the Marriott were wonderful to work with.  This was the first time we hosted at event at this location.  The responsiveness of the staff was superb in setting up the event.  There were proactive in keeping our group on track with logistical issues leading up to the event.  On the day of the event, they checked in on us frequently and promptly addressed any concerns our group had.\n\nWe had some problems with the reservations agents indicating that no rooms were available at the conference rate.  The other problem has to do with the layout of the conference rooms.  There is one conference room (the Monona Room) located by the front desk, far away from all the other meeting rooms.  On the day before the event, you guessed it; the Marriott staff moved us to that room.  The calendar of events is not conspicuous, so on the day of the event, all the conference attended entered the facility through the conference center doors and wandered about searching for the Monona Room.\n\nLike most conference facility, the food was a mixed bag.\n\nThings I liked:\n* I enjoyed the caesar salad served with lunch with fresh greens (no iceberg lettuce), tangy dressing and herbed croutons that did not go overboard with the salt or garlic.\n\n* Other than the overcooked noodles, the penne pasta with mushroom, spinach, goat cheese, pine nuts and roasted red pepper cream was a well-executed dish.\n\n* While the filling had a bit too much citrus flavor, kudos to the kitchen staff for serving us a cannoli with a crunchy shell, a rarity on the conference food circuit.\n\nThings I didn't:\n* The rigatoni with fennel sausage, roasted peppers and arriabiatta sauce lacked the finesse of the aforementioned penne pasta dish.  With its mushy noodles, overcooked sauce and under-seasoned sausage, there was little to like.\n\n* If you enjoy a heavy does of garlic powder on bread with the texture of a teething biscuit, you would love the garlic bread served with the pasta course.\n\n* My least favorite dish was toasted cheese sandwich served during the planning session the day before the conference.  For $14.95, I expected aged cheddar served on gently grilled slices of artisan sourdough bread.  What I received was very different.  Served barely warm, the bread was soaked in butter and toasted to a brick-like texture that left cuts on the roof of my mouth.  The institutional grade cheddar and provolone cheese had started to congeal by the time the staff served it to me.  The server did not check in with us because she didn't want to interfere with our meeting, preventing me from sending this dish back for a replacement.  The roasted tomato soup, though cool, was the redeeming feature of my meal.\n\nOverall, the experience with the Marriott Madison West was A-OK, based on the positive interactions with the staff, which offset the spotty food quality.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA"}

I've stayed in Madison plenty of times for work, and overall, this is the nicest hotel that I've stayed at.  Pros: staff are very nice and friendly.  Hotel has gym, pool, and business center at no additional cost.  You know how some hotels have that teeny tiny kiosk to print your boarding pass, and that's all you can do?  There are 2 computers hooked up to printers so can you do real tasks like check your email, Yelp, etc.  The beds are VERY comfortable.  It shocked me how nice they were.  Bathrooms have stone countertops and something heating the mirror, so that after a shower your mirror is still usable, not all fogged up.  Someone had their thinking hat on.  The hotel is walkable to several restaurants & I think they provide room service, but they will also help you order from a nearby restaurant if you arrive late in the evening.\n\nFor a hotel this size, they do a really good job with breakfast.  It's a buffet with the usual cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, oatmeal, pastries, and hot food.  But they really go an extra mile on the eggs, and every egg dish is cooked to order.  Whether you want 1 scrambled egg or full omelette, they'll make it for you fresh, give you a table tent number, and then bring it to you.\n\nI have 2 more trips this year to Madison, and hope I'm staying here again!", "type": "review", "business_id": "MBQc_jlZ3nlMOZy7SUM_5Q"}

We ended up ordering the patty melt, ok, fish sandwich, subpar, and onion rings, good but not $3 good. Sandwiches come with chips, not fries.  But was definitely not the pancakes that everyone else was raving about that I was craving.  The coffee was sting but a bit bitter. The total was just under $20 without tip. \n\nThe decor is old, doesn't bother me too much, but looking at the filthy carpets, it was disgusting and I was a bit afraid since I was wearing flat sandals.  Before I forget to mention it, the place smells like smoke when you first walk in, I was completely expecting to see ashtrays at the booths.\n\nThe service was excellent... If you are a regular. If not, plan on spending about three times too much there. We waited for about 5 minutes for our waitress ( one of the owners) to shout sit where you want.  We grabbed a table. My husband had to take a work call, but had given me his order. After waiting 10 minutes, I had to flag our waitress down to place our orders, and she looked at me shocked that I would want something to eat. Trying to get the check out of her was terrible. By 12:15 the lunch regulars had started coming in, so she was chatting about a recent wedding, showings hem the wedding pictures, talking about what the place looked like, etc. by 12:30 I had out cash on the end of the table hoping to move things along.  She walked past us three times without making eye contact, finally, I put my arm out and asked for the check, which had not been prepared, wait for another 5 minutes while she served more regulars and FINALLY she got back to using we were out of there by 12:50. \n\nIn short, we will never return.

Warranted, yes.  Read on.\n\n\nI'm convinced that Dick & Arnie's is one of Madison's/Middleton's best kept secrets.  True, Dick isn't around much - but in his defense, he's probably been cutting hair for 50+ years, so he deserves some time away.\n\nThat said, I've gone back twice since my last review (my hair grows fast), and every cut has been absolutely stellar.  Ka, who has cut my hair the last two times, is absolutely wonderful.  Very attentive, very helpful, extremely friendly, and really knows how to cut hair.  \n\nThe place seems to thrive on walk-ins, so don't bother making an appointment.  I think that trying to schedule an appointment is the only downside to Dick & Arnie's... and, it was my only source of frustration.  As soon as I accepted the fact that it's best to just walk-in, life has been great.\n\nSet aside 30-40 minutes and walk-in.  Your haircut will take 15-20 minutes, tops; the extra time is \"cushion\" just in case the place is full.  Don't worry about who does your hair - everyone there seems to know exactly what they're doing, and they do it well.\n\n$15 for a stellar haircut?  No brainer.  Go to Dick & Arnies, appreciate it for what it is, and leave with an excellent haircut.  You won't be disappointed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_tnYCShXuDlXjNVNctTkCA"}

Fish was solid - nicely done, especially for the price and speed.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nI'd never visited the Middleton Sport Bowl prior to today, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  We arrived exactly at noon, parked, and made our way to the bar, where we found two seats and were promptly greeted by a bartender.\n\nWe both ordered the lunch special - 2 piece deep fried cod plate with fries, slaw, tartar, dinner roll, and soda.  The bartender took our order and came back with a complimentary bowl of popcorn, which was a nice surprise.\n\nPlates arrived about 10 minutes later - the fish was appropriately sized, as were the fries - no imbalance, and portions were fair.\n\nThe fish itself had a flavorful beer batter that was a little thicker than what you'll typically find at most places, but it was delicious and I welcomed the extra crunch.\n\nInside, the fish itself was a tad watery with just a hint of grease - not anything outrageous, but just enough to sense that it was there.  Flavor of the fish was incredibly mild; the batter stole some of its thunder.  \n\nThe fries were excellent - battered-style and straight cut.  I'm told the slaw and tartar were \"average.\"  Dinner roll was hard and dry.\n\nTotal lunch bill for two: $14.64, and we were in-and-out within 35 minutes.  Totally acceptable and a good lunch, all things considered.\n\nMiddleton Sport Bowl = NEUTRAL\n\nFood = 2.75 to 3 stars (average; not bad, not spectacular)\nService = 3.5 stars (prompt and friendly)\nValue = 4 stars \nMISC = 3 stars (actually seemed to be a nice bowling alley/bar)\n\nSummary: Not a win, nor a fail.

I'll briefly break down how I gauge them (I've been many times, both before and after the renovation)\n\nFacility:  Great environment, a reasonable number of lanes (although not as many as other alleys in the area), a roomy bar with TVs for the sports games, and an upstairs that has both pool as well as a rental area that hosts private functions or tournaments.\n\nCost:  Fairly cheap if you go on open bowling nights, I think it's around $1 or $2 a game plus shoes.  I'm sure it's hiked up otherwise.  Open Bowling is usually after 9pm during the week and not a bad option.  We used to go on Thursdays which seems to be a good night for them.\n\nFood:  It's typical bar food.  They have good cheese curds, and the usual fare that you'd see at an alley.  Nothing to write home about but if you're in the mood for a greasy burger you probably won't go wrong.\n\nService:  I cannot stand the people that work at the counter.  There's a couple of older guys (50-60+) who obviously hate life and want to project that on you when you're there.  Everytime I've gone in I've tried to be courteous and polite, and asked simple basic questions like \"I'd like to get a lane, there's 3 of us and we all need shoes\" etc, etc.  These guys first look at you like you walked into the wrong bar, and then respond with gruff, 2 second answers that doesn't help either party move the process along.  It's really irritating because I've gone to this alley off and on for probably about 10 years or so, and it's always been like that.  The bartenders, when you get a woman, are usually friendly and don't share the same attitude.\n\nPersonally I'm more of a Schwoeglers guy, but their prices for open bowling are more expensive and the atmosphere is noiser, so Sport Bowl sometimes wins out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lN-5-YTsaJr_IByyA476iw"}

If the shoes fit, the ball rolls down the lane, and the pins fall down, it's fine.\n\nThis review is all about the food.  Which, if you can't tell by the number of stars above these paragraphs, is pretty tasty.  To start, the cheese curds are required eating.  I think they just take cheddar cheese cubes, bread them, and fry them, but they are delicious when fresh.  Make sure to eat them quick, however, because, like all cheese curds, they harden when they cool and have a weird texture after that point.  \n\nWhen you think bar food, you think burgers.  And the burgers at the Sport Bowl are excellent.  Not only are they excellent, they are fairly priced as well.  At lunch, you can get a burger + fries (battered!) + soda for eight bucks.  I can see some people thinking the burgers are too greasy, but the grease gives you a delightful \"contented, weighed down, and fuzzy-brained\" feeling afterwards.  \n\nA quick rundown on other items I've tried: the meatball sub was so-so, but huge.  Go to Gino's a mile away if you're craving meatballs.  The turkey club is stacked high and tastes exactly as you would expect.  The patty melt is just a burger on bread, so obviously it rules hard.  The pizza is decent, with a crust that tastes like Pizza Hut's deep dish.  The fish fry is a lot of good food for a good price.  The \"Philly\" cheesesteak is too greasy even for me.\n\nThe best part about the Sport Bowl is that if you feel some postprandial guilt for your frenzied ingestion of large amounts of fat and grease, you can pop over to Willy West next door to get an organic hippie-smoothie.

The Stamm House is walking distance from home, so I figured we HAD to try it... \n\nFirst off, let me say that the atmosphere is typical old(emphasis on the old)-school Wisconsin restaurant. Wood paneling, dated tables and chairs, and GOD AWFUL seventies music piped in. When we walked in(at six on a Saturday night) there was one couple at the bar, and another couple dining upstairs near us. The waiter seated us--close to the kitchen, I realized with disappointment. If I want to hear dishes clanging and the hustle and bustle, I'd be cooking at home. Dining out is for pretending that there's no work involved. It also didn't help that because it was so slow in the restaurant, I could hear every comment the waiter said to the cook-staff, some of which wasn't patron-friendly. \n\nThe BF ordered the fried walleye,and I the beef tips Moutarde. His french onion soup was decent, but my salad was lacking. When the meal arrived, I was so excited because I was STARVED. I picked up a piece of beef with my fork and bit down into tender, juicy...FAT. Fatty fatty fatness. Ewww. I did the not-so-sexy-spit-it-onto-the-side-plate maneuver. All right. Every now and then you get a fatty piece of meat in a dish. A girl can move on. MY next bite was better, and although the sauce was decent, it was nothing fabulous. I was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty. You know when you get that cheap meat that is mostly sinew and fat. *Sigh* I'm done. I pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato. \n\nTo give credit, the waiter noticed I wasn't eating the dish, and asked me if something was wrong. I told him, and he offered to get me something else, which I declined(by the time it was made, Chris would have been done with his dish). Later, he also offered a free dessert, which we really didn't want. He ended up knocking almost half off my dish, which was appropriate, I think. \n\nOver all, it just wasn't enjoyable. I could have gotten over picking a bad dish if the experience itself was nice, but it wasn't. Average at best. The waiter was decent and tried to be accommodating, but on the whole, it was just sub-par. I left wishing that I had picked another spot to spend my hard earned date-night budget! I realize that a place like this isn't going to be gourmet, but I've had MUCH better casual dining experiences...for less money!", "type": "review", "business_id": "IEmqrFe96NOhU07TA0rZdw"}

Unfortunately, that's about all it has to offer, unless you enjoy food that is extremely greasy, and of mediocre quality.\n\nDetailed review: Our fish fry crew decided to give Stamm House a try after we'd read good things about it on a fairly well known fish fry review website.  Normally, those guys (the reviewers) are pretty spot on, but they've completely missed the mark when it comes to the Stamm House.  Not even close to being a top-10 place, no way, no how.\n\nWe sauntered in to the Stamm House at around 5:45 on Friday night and were shocked to find the place darned-near empty.  The bartender greeted us immediately - very friendly guy - we ordered a couple of New Glarus Nakeds and a Spotted Cow.  After downing the first round, we went to order a refill, and whoops - Naked went empty, and there wasn't any more left.  Drat.\n\nAfter downing a second round of beers (Cows all around this time), it dawned on us that we probably needed to inquire about a table.  So, we wandered upstairs where a friendly lady told us she'd have an opening at around 6:45 or 7:00.  Odd, the place was empty... but, we took it and went back downstairs.\n\nWe ordered some cheese curds and the onion rings.  The bartender warned us ahead of time that the curds were \"standard-from-the-bag\" curds, but said the rings were hand-battered and delicious.  They arrived quickly, and once again, the bartender was spot-on with his description.\n\nThe curds were Sysco curds and were not cooked well at all.  I don't think the fryer was hot enough, because these curds were drenched in grease - so much so that we couldn't eat them.  Disgusting.  And the ranch dipping sauce was like water... you know what they say about oil and water... \n\nThe rings were decent, but again - the grease was ridiculous.  It really made for a bad first impression.  So, we ordered some Whiskey Old Fashioned Sours to help cut through the grease film that was sitting so heavily on our palettes.  \n\nOur table was ready by 7:00-ish, and much to our surprise, when we went upstairs this time, the place was packed.  Where those people came from, and how they got up there without us noticing remains a mystery... our waitress stopped promptly, checked our drinks, and took our order - fried perch all the way around with hash browns on the side.\n\nDinner salads came first and were nice; fairly fresh, fairly tasty, and just the right size.  Fish came out slightly later - served family style - along with our hash browns.  First bite of the fish?  UGH - it tasted awful.  Extremely fishy flavor (and I love fish).  Think \"stinky NJ ocean shore line flavor\" - not delicate, flavorful, flaky, and enjoyable.  No sir, this was the nightmarishly bad fish that we all remember from our grade school days - you know, the stuff that was about 2-3 days away from being used as feed for the sea lions at the zoo  \n\nSo, we doused it with lemon and gave it another go - and once again, the fish was so overpoweringly fishy that we reached for the (gasp!) ketchup.  That helped a bit, but it still wasn't an enjoyable fish fry.  The fish was cooked well - not too greasy, and it was breaded rather than battered.  If only it weren't so obscenely fishy...   \n\nHash browns were tasty - fried nicely (crisp and tasty).  Service was fantastic - our waitress was fun, helpful, and did a great job of checking in with us.  Total bill for three with a round or two of drinks was $45-ish.\n\nStamm House = FAIL\n\nFood: 1 star (grease, grease everywhere; horrible fish fry)\nService: 4.5 stars \nValue: 3 stars\n\n\nSummary: waaaaay too greasy + waaaaaay too fishy fish = fail.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IEmqrFe96NOhU07TA0rZdw"}

(Unless you count the onion rings appetizer which tasted like most deep-fried onion ring appetizers.)\n\nSome of you know me now as someone who LOVES tradition and history and preservation and stuff-like-that.  \n\nSo we came here for the tradition (great old supper club from the 40's), the history (an1847 stagecoach inn, later a stop on the Underground Railway, and a Speakeasy circa Prohibition) and the preservation (it's hard to keep a 150-year old lady going in style).\n\nSo we came to DRINK and PLAY, in other words, on a busy Friday night, in spite of, or because of, the fish fry.  We grabbed some stools but found ourselves giving up our seats to some lovely ladies who were waiting to be seated for the fish fry.  (Like I said, we weren't here for the food, but I gotta wonder why the fish fry was JAM PACKED CONSTANTLY.)\n\nAfter bugging the extremely convivial bartender about the history of the place, and begging to see the \"wine cellar\"/slave-holding-tank in the basement, he tossed his apron at someone and announced an impromptu \"tour\".  WOW!\n\nIt was cool to say the least, imagining the terrified slaves packed into the \"secret\" cellar, with its curved brick walls.  So we took turns squeezing in and out, then returned to the bar and proceeded to enjoy tons of conversation with the locals.

The only real qualm I have with the store is that 75% of the store is dedicated to Women's shoes. Which is fine but It would be nice to see a little but bigger selection for Men's shoes. Also their slippers are SUPER COMFY. One final thing is that they have some great coupons every so often here. Keep and eye out!", "type": "review", "business_id": "JfBxZQCRtPoNewr6QM8Hng"}

The bartender was ON - never missed a beat, never left our glasses empty, and was very helpful.  5+ stars.\n\nDrinks? Limited tap selection, although they have a few interesting items: Great Lakes Ale and Esthers Best were two that stood out as fun and not what you'd normally find at a more mainstream location.  They also have daily drink specials - we tried the Lemon Smash (hand squeezed (with each drink) lemonade + vodka) and the Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour.  Both were great.\n\nFood? We tried the famous chili - meaty, slightly spicy, and delish.  Not the best I've ever had, but not bad by any means.  We tried the vegetable beef soup - hearty, loaded with veggies, and the meat was tender and of good quality.  \n\nFor our entrees, we went a bit conservative - grilled chicken salads - but they were huge and tasty.  Fresh, fresh, fresh veggies - the tomatoes were wonderful as were the onions (red, and soooo sweet).  The salad was definitely an unexpected surprise - I'd get it again in a heartbeat!  \n\nOur dining companion ordered some chicken strips which he requested be tossed in their hot wings sauce.  The result?  Wow - tasty, especially if you're a fan of vinegar-based wing sauce that packs a bit of a kick.  Really, really good.\n\nSo, we'll definitely be back - I'm becoming a huge fan of the \"local\" places, and the Village Green is definitely a \"local\" place.  I can't wait to try a burger or to enjoy some of their other drink specials.\n\nVillage Green = WIN\n\nFood = 3.75 stars\nService = 5 stars\nValue = 2.75 stars (a bit pricey; $35 for 2 with drinks)\nOverall = 3.75 - 4 stars (atmosphere, service, general vibe, selection = big boost)", "type": "review", "business_id": "G1qUGBNYNS220jKlPAlFsA"}

Once you've been there a few times, everyone who works there begins to recognize you and seems glad to see you. They have a small menu of yummy fried items (Spudsters!), great burgers and sandwiches, and daily specials (love the French Dip on Wednesdays). All the food is cooked right behind the bar, and they keep their cooking equipment impeccably clean. They make good drinks and have a small but respectable selection of draft beers that meet the needs of both craft beer lovers and Miller Lite-types. Bartenders are not afraid to do a shot of whiskey with you, and many of the regular patrons will buy you a drink if you chat with them. \n\nThe Green is owned by two brothers who are almost always there, cooking or bartending. The place is closed on Sundays, and rarely stays open past midnight - it's just not that sort of bar. Go across the street to Hody for late-night drinking.

All new equipment and works great. \n\nI have been using this place since I discovered it about a year ago. The remodeling took place in November and December 2012. Previously this was just car wash station with about 8 self serve stalls and 2 or three automatic. The remodeling removed some of the self service stalls (there are approx. 4 now) and used this space for a new Laundramat and a dog wash station, which i hear is one of the only ones in the Madison area. \n\nI have been there mostly on Sundays and they have an attendant who is an older gentlemen and is very friendly and fun to shoot the breeze with if you use the self service stations. Personally, I believe you cant get a better car wash than using the self service stations if you have the time and strength (your arms do get a little sore after!). For 5 dollars I believe, you get 12 minutes which is plenty of time to do a thorough wash, rinse, wax and time to use scrubber on front end/rims as needed. The soap is not watered down like other places. They also take credit card at the self service station, so no need to fill a sock full of quarters. The only other self service I know of in the Madison area is off Rimrock road, which is cheaper, but for less time, in a rough area, in terrible shape,  and the soap is MUCH more watered down. \n\nI have also used the laundramat there recently and received exceptional serivce. They have a special going on in March that all dryers are free! All new machines, therefore clothes come out smelling and looking great. In addition, this is a full service laundramat, therefore there is a regular attendant on duty who will do the washing, drying and foling for you. I believe the charge was 49 cents for every lb. They also have a promotion going on right now for the first 10lbs are free. It is a very convenient service if you have a lot of errands to run and dont want to waste an afternoon at the laundramat. I had quite a bit of laundry one day, and the attendant gave me a very good deal in addition to the 10 lbs free. Make sure to tip the attendant if you use this service, she did an excellent job and saves you a ton of time!\n\nI have not used the dog wash, as I do not have a dog, but I imagine it could be something fun to do.\n\nThe only negative I have about this place is that is hard to get in and out of, as you have to pull in behind the building and turn the corner of the building at a blind spot. Its about as narrow as one lane, and people come in and out of same drag.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qNBvH111qgJgLYUScbph7g"}

Although this location carries the Aveda name, it appears to be buckling under its weight. There are many issues at this salon, and only a few will be mentioned here.\n\nTangles Salon has had a somewhat tortured existence here in the Madison area, what with experiencing not-so-smooth management changes, relocating attempts, massive employee walkouts, and even a fire in the past 2 years alone. One begins to wonder how they have stayed afloat as long as they have.\n\nAfter a devastating fire destroyed Tangles, it was clear that many once loyal customers had been caught in the middle of the chaos. Some arrived at the salon for their appointments, only to find the building in charred ruins, and most never got a courtesy call from the owners. Furthermore, the fire raises red flags related to safety, Although not mentioned in the police report, many ex-clients have speculated that the entire situation was suspicious.\n\nA receptionist named Deeon, was at the front desk when I last entered Tangles. He welcomed me to the salon, but his demeanor was cold and businesslike. He seemed very out of place in the salon, and didn't seem to really enjoy being there as he led me to the chair. I waited for 10 minutes for my stylist to come over from the very noisy break room I was unfortunate enough to have been next to. As I was waiting, I noticed an accumulation of hair and dust around the edges of the station. There were also many dead insects in the overhead fluorescent lighting, indicating lack of cleanliness throughout the salon.\n\nOn the plus side, Tangles does have some talented stylists. But without the proper management and support, their work remains spotty and inconsistent at best.\n\nI wanted to like this salon, but found it difficult to look past the issues. It is important to note that it is difficult for any business to survive changing locations multiple times. However, when combined with the suspicious fire, the disgruntled clients, and the unstable behind the scenes management, it is safe to say that Tangles needs a deep conditioning treatment if they want to remain relevant in this city.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mbtGl2I2A2To-8jiggN99g"}

I made the appointment and the day before the appointment they contacted me to  tell me that the nail tech that I was scheduled with called in sick.  When I stated that my appointment was for the next day at 11:30 , they indicated that she was going to be out then as well.  Ok, I was fine with this, and they offered to get me in at 2:00 or 3:00.   I indicated that I would have to check my calendar and would call them right back, but she put me in  for 3:00 temporarly.  I called back 10 minutes later to let them know that I could not make 3:00 work due an appointment I had at work and would need to have my pedicure at 2:00.  This was done via voice mail and asked them to call me back to confirm this was still available.  I did not receive a call back, and followed up with a new call to Tangles the following morning, which was the day of my appointment and I left a new voice mail message to confirm that they received my previous voice mail and please call me back.   I did not receive a call, so one would assume that they had me down for 2:00.  I took a late lunch from work, and drove over to their location on Whitney Way which is a good 20 minute drive and when I arrived, was told they had me down for 3:00 and that they were booked and could not get me at 2:00.   At this point I was very frustrated, due to the lack of not responding to my voice mail messages. The receptionist told me she was aware of my calls, but did not have the time to call me back, since they were so busy.    This took an hour of my day, and a gallon of gas to drive there, and  was not offered any  compensation for their lack of not informing me that they were now booked at 2:00, even though I told them I would call right back to confirm either 2:00 or 3:00.      This is the poorest customer service I have ever recieved by far from a salon!!   I wonder how they plan on staying in business, when they treat clients in this matter and have no regard for their time and money, ($3.80 a gallon for gas).  I understand that sometimes it is necessary to adjust an appointment, but the lack of respect for my time is over the top for me.   Also when a salon signs up to offer a Group On deal, I would assume the goal for  doing this is to try and build their business wth new clients.   If they do not have the capablity to handle new clients, then they should not be offering this type of promotion.     Not A New Client!", "type": "review", "business_id": "mbtGl2I2A2To-8jiggN99g"}

I received a shellac manicure, partial highlight and conditioning treatment and based on what I spent on the Living Social coupon I am satisfied with the results, but if I had paid full price for these services I would be very dissatisfied.  \n\nThere was just something \"off\" about my entire experience at Tangles.  The salon and nail room looked messy and unorganized, as did most of the hair stylists and nail technicians.  I didn't get that \"Aveda vibe\" at all, more like the \"Cost Cutters vibe\" (nothing against CC, but if I'm paying $75 for highlights I'd like the atmosphere to match the price).

Both times the waitstaff has been professional, helpful, and speedy.  The music is at an appropriate level, the atmosphere is cozy, the decor tasteful.  The wine list is extensive, and many dishes on the menu seem appetizing and imaginative at first glance.  With all of these elements going for it, I have high expectations for the food.  Although some of it is delicious, some significant problems have arisen when I've dined there.\n\nI have had both the bruschetta and the mussels as appetizers.  The bruschetta portion was a bit smaller than I expected, but it packs a large amount of flavor into the bites.  The tomatoes tasted fresh and sweet, and balanced well against the (presumably) homemade pesto.  The fresh bread served at the table is similarly warm, with a crisp crust and toothsome interior.  The mussels are flavorful and delicious, but they don't come with any bread to sop up the flavorful broth that remains after the mussels have been eaten.  Our plate was whisked away before we had a chance to ask for any bread to go with the sauce.\n\nTwo of my companions ordered the Ravioli al Vin Santo; both liked and finished the dish.  It is one of four vegetarian options (the Fettucini alla Putenesca does not list meat, but I've never heard of a putanesca sauce made without anchovies), which was a welcome surprise for the vegetarian with whom I dined.  One companion ordered the Insalata di Caesare (which also has unlisted anchovies in the dressing), and found it flavorful, if unimaginative.  A fourth companion ordered the Lasagna del Giorno (that day it was with roasted chicken), and savored every bite.  A fifth companion ordered the Fettucini alla Putenesca, of which I tried a bite.  The spinach fettucini was fresh and delicious, and the sauce was perfectly salty.  My entree, the Campenelli il Diavolillo, was pretty awful.  The combination of meat and seafood in a dish can be done artfully, but this felt like a clumsy mishmash of shrimp, chicken, and Italian sausage.  The sausage was very sweet and seemed to lack enough oregano, basil, and garlic.  It clashed notably with the rest of the dish.  The shrimp and chicken were both cooked well, and were tender and juicy.  The pasta was fresh and tasty.  It was really a shame that the \"spicy garlic broth\" as described by the menu translated into nearly an inch of oil at the bottom of the dish, making the entire dish almost inedible.  All portions were huge.\n\nThe desserts are delicious.  The tiramisu, which I sampled on my first visit, is fluffy and sweet.  I tried to order it on my return visit, but the waitress told me she had sold the last piece to a table that came in after us.  Since we arrived at 5 p.m., this came as quite a shock.  It seems unlikely that they started the evening's service with more than one piece of tiramisu, and seems like profoundly poor planning.  The bread pudding, while not much to look at, is also delicious, though it is so rich that by the time we finished one portion (between three people) it almost felt like i was eating a stick of butter rolled in cinnamon.\n\nI can't say I'll be back anytime soon.  I have to disagree with Zenide R.'s assertion that it's \"easily the best Italian food in the Madison area.\"  For the price, both Lombardino's and Tutto Pasta make better Italian food, and I shall stick to those restaurants in the future.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q8fD82us6uuGufvI44NoAg"}

The atmosphere is homey and intimate. I had the spaghetti with pine nuts, olives, capers, and anchovies in homemade tomato sauce. This dish was alright. I liked the idea of adding pine nuts, but the olives AND capers made it too salty for my tastes. I had some leftovers and they were definitely better the next day even if they were still a little salty. \n\nDEFINITELY get the Tirimasu cake while there. It was wonderful. Not too rich, but soaked in expresso and very flavorful. There is a mascarpone cheese based whip cream which is light and not too sweet that makes the cake amazing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q8fD82us6uuGufvI44NoAg"}

We ended the night with the tiramisu .... and let me tell you, I am a tiramisu connoisseur (i pretty much order it every time it's on the menu) and this was the BEST tiramisu I have ever had.

The hostess and servers are friendly, and the food is delicious. Entrees are large and flavorful. Salads are also large and fresh. Salad is not included with an entree, but if you decide to add one to your order, I suggest splitting it. The salad is large enough to be a meal for some folks. \n\nFor an entree, I highly recommend the scampi diavalio. It's a heavenly dish with campanelle pasta, sausage, chicken, shrimp, bell peppers, onions, and olive oil. There are also some red pepper flakes to add a spicy kick, but the spice is definitely not overpowering to my taste. \n\nOverall, this is a wonderful local restaurant with a cozy, friendly atmosphere and great food.

None of us had ever been there.\nWhile the food overall wasnt the WORST I've had, I wouldnt recommend eating there unless someone buys your meal for you, or youve been stranded on a desert island for 5 years and this is the first \"real\" meal you've had in ages.  To some, it may make you want to go back to the island...atleast food is fresh.\n\nWe arrived 10 mins after the 4 other people of our party, after 20 more minutes the waiter came back to see what we wanted to drink.  Forgot to note, for a Friday night at 7:30 the place was pretty much empty in the dining area.\n\nI ordered a diet pepsi and the others ordered random alcoholic drinks.  My soda was flat, watery and had some kind of scum on top of it.  I thought I may be crazy, so everyone at the table tried the soda and agreed it was disgusting.  Waiter came back and I asked for a diet dew instead.  Received a diet dew that tasted a little less flat.....but now the glass had a leak in it while went everywhere.  Asked for a glass from the bar w diet pepsi.  It seemed a little less flat, but not by much.  Atleast that glass was clean.\nFriend ordered the hog heaven, bloody mary with bacon infused vodka.  He said it wasnt the worst drink, but mainly tasted like greasy bacon fat, not a smokey bacon flavor.  Didnt try it myself.\n\nAfter the soda ordeal, it had been 20 mins since we arrived I ordered some Moo-skis as an appetizer, which are listed as hashbrowns covered in bacon, onion, and cheese from what i remember.\n20 mins after that waiter came back to take our order.  I gave him my order of all you can eat fish and asked about the appetizer.  He said \"oh ya, forgot about those, theyll be right up.\"\n5 or 6 minutes later, he came back to check our drink status, and said \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.....you had moo-skis.....theyll be here soon.\"\n5 or 6 mins later again he brought out the moo-skis.\n\nThey were hashbrowns on a small side plate with a small layer of shredded mozza on top.  Very plain and greasy tasting.  Realized there should be bacon and onion...which i found tiiiiny few far between pieces inside hash later.  For the 3 or 4 dollars, would have been better used for just plain hashbrowns at a diner for a dollar.\n\nFinally get the all you can eat fish which had 2 pieces of pollock, beer battered fries, tartar, and coleslaw:\nFish: ok sized. breading was hard(which i like), taste ok. Not worst Ive had, but no where near good.\nFries: Were best part of the meal.\nTartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color.  didnt taste any dill.\nColeslaw:  Im not sure you could even call this slaw.  It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage.  Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy...it was literally SOUP.\n\nOrdered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar.\n\nWe were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish.\nHe came back with our checks after 10 mins.  We laughed that the forgetting of the fish was on par w our night.  2 friends paid seperate and we had 2 parties of 2.  Super simple orders, but he ended up bringing the bills up wrong 3 times so we had to continue to correct.  Had to take our payments one at a time which added another 10 mins.\n\nFinishing up our bills........and kitchen staff brings me the last piece of fish about 30 mins after ordering it and when we were getting up.\n\nMaybe it was a one time bad experience, but considering how dead it was on a friday night....Im guessing our experience is pretty representative of the food/wait staff which is a shame since the place really has a nice flair or feel inside it.\n\nThe best part of the experience was the upbeat classic 80s music.\n\nWe  all received buy one get one coupons upon leaving.  Not sure if it was just us or everyone gets them.\n\n30 mins after getting home, I spent lots of time in the bathroom as it all came rushing out the bottom pipes.  I have an iron stomach and don't get messed up by much.\n\ngirlfriend edit:  Reminded me she didnt get the salad she ordered and had to ask.  Also noted her old fashioned came w cherries and olives in it, which is taboo? Supposed to be one or other?

Quaint and cozy, lots of comfort foods.  Nothing spectacular, though the homemade breads are quite good.  A bit on the pricey side and can fill-up with people quickly, especially on the weekends.\n\nDetailed review:\nI've lived near C's for about a year now, and have never stopped-in to check it out.  Folks at work gave mixed reviews - some raved about the place, others gave it a \"Meh.\"  I run past it nearly every morning and they always seem to have a good-sized crowd, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, so I figured it had to be somewhat decent... with that, I treated myself to a breakfast this morning.\n\nI wandered in at around 9:30am on Memorial Day and was pleased to find plenty of seating.  The hostess offered me a table outside, which was a nice bonus - the weather was gorgeous, so I happily took the offer.  I also grabbed one of their complimentary/shared newspapers to read.\n\nA waitress stopped by to ask for my drink order - I went with coffee - and to drop off a menu.  She came back a few minutes later with an acrylic coffee cup and a stainless coffee carafe.  She left to tend to another table; I needed some cream for the coffee... oh well, it was nice and I was happy to continue browsing the menu, sans cream for my coffee.\n\nBreakfast offerings were ordinary: eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, omelets, skillets, and a couple of extras, like eggs benedict, belgian waffles, and some homemade pastries (turnovers, donuts, muffins, cookies, etc).\n\nThe waitress stopped by to ask if I was ready to order - told her I decided on the \"Hen's Nest\" which consisted of 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and toast.  I also ordered a pancake, and requested some cream for the coffee.  She apologized and immediately brought some half-n-half containers.  We were in business.  \n\nBefore leaving to take my order to the kitchen, she asked if I'd like anything in the hashbrowns.  I was pleased!  C's has some specialty hashbrown items on the menu, but I didn't want to order a huge plate of them... so, when the offer surfaced to add onions, peppers, tomatoes, etc to my potatoes, I jumped at the chance.\n\nFood came about 20 minutes later and looked tasty.  The pancake was a lot thinner than I had pictured, but it was quite tasty.  I found myself wishing I had ordered 2.  \n\nThe Hen's Nest was just \"OK\" - the hashbrowns weren't greasy and featured a nice, crispy char,  but the onions and peppers didn't do much for flavor, oddly enough... I found the entire dish to be largely flavorless.  :-(  \n\nThe multigrain toast was very good - and was probably the star of the entire meal.  The waitress only stopped by once more - to drop off the check, which was a bit of a shocker as well... $12 for my modest breakfast - $5.99 for the Hen's Nest, $0.89 for adding extras to the hashbrowns, $2.99 for one (1) pancake (!!!), $1.89 for coffee.\n\nService = 2 stars (nothing great)\nFood = 3 stars (average breakfast fare)\nValue = 1.5 stars (quite pricey for what it was)\nMISC = 3 stars (bakery items looked stellar, nice outdoor patio, very relaxing)\n\nI'd really like to give C's 2.5 stars, but I'm feeling a bit generous so, it's a 3-star \"gift\" rating.  Had I been in a crankier mood, it would've gone 2-stars... :-)\n\nFor what it's worth, I think the Hubbard Avenue Diner has a better overall breakfast, and it's about 1/2 the price.  It'll probably be a while before I visit C's again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "B0Vuwn6Hugc-0U5n31YBfg"}

Clean, tasty and fairly reasonably priced. It is not a huge place either, but there was PLENTY of waitstaff to keep things moving. \n\nI had the skillet breakfast, which I was very pleased to find had the option of turkey. (This made me happy, as I like meat at breakfast after a night of rainy camping, but am allergic to pork.) The skillet had turkey, potatoes, onions and green peppers mixed together, with toast and 2 eggs on top. The eggs were perfect, which impressed me, given how crazy busy the place was. I do have one complaint about my food 'tho, the onions, peppers and potatoes were not cooked enough for my taste. In fact, the onions were damn near raw. Luckily, they were finely shredded, so it wasn't too bad, but I take away a star for that .\n\n(BF says his potatoes were underdone too. Not raw, but not quite done enough.)\n\nWaitstaff was very good about keeping coffee filled. And, since it was a bakery, we HAD to at least try a cinnamon roll.

You do not get a beer to start off, which sucks. You have to buy one for $3.50 before the tour leaves, or you will be tempted to lick it off the floor during the tour. The tour is about a half-hour, not the most interesting thing I have ever been to, but not bad. Our guide was kind of obnoxious, but grew on us as the time grew on. After the tour, (weather permitting, I assume) you go outside to the beer garden to get your 2oz. mug to start sampling. The guide has to go around and fill up everyone on the tour (~50 people) before you get your beers, so budget an extra hour to sample. \n\nSo in the end, you get 8x 2oz. samples and a tiny beer shot glass for $2.50. Not a bad deal; they just need to make the beers at the bar cheaper so you can leave with a smile on your face.\n\nI believe they do tours on the weekends at 1:30 and 3:30, and they do offer then during weekdays.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Wn8NhS-L1ck6jbTjX88Kkg"}

I've never done the tour or hung out in the Bier Stube, though they're both on my list, but between Memorial Day and Halloween I try to make my way over to Terrace Avenue as often as possible.  It's also become somewhat of a tradition amongst my friends to go to Bockfest in February as well as wait in line for Great Taste tickets in May.  These are good times in their own regard, but the best times I've had here are just the random summer nights spent sitting at a picnic table with friends or watching a band playing on stage.  On weekend nights during the summer the place gets packed, especially if a band is playing.  And while it's pretty easy to find Capital beers on tap or at stores throughout the area, nothing beats fresh from the brewery.  As an added bonus, you can often get the seasonals or other less prominent beers on tap here as opposed to the bottles prevalent elsewhere.  This past summer my go-to was the Wild Rice Lager, as well as the Supper Club lager on the really hot nights.  There's even a few wine choices for the non-beer drinking crowd, including Wollersheim's Prairie Fume.  \n\nI've got a decent history going on with the Bier Garten, as this was one of the places I went on my 21st birthday.  My buddy purchased me one of the half-liter plastic mugs as my birthday present.  I've still got it to this day, and I bring it with every time I go out.  Suffice it to say, however much that mug cost has been more than offset by the reduced cost per ounce offered by the mug.  If you're planning on coming back I definitely recommend making the investment.  It beats the regular 16 oz plastic cups and I'd hazard a guess it's comparable to getting a pitcher, without the necessity of coming to agreement on what beer to order.\n\nThere isn't any food service whatsoever, but it's perfectly fine to bring in your own with you.  My personal go-to is Gino's, but there's plenty of places nearby and I believe you can ask for take-out menus of local restaurants up at the counter.  I've even ordered Falbo's for delivery pizza a couple times - just meet them outside the gate by road.  Capital's also put up a large tent over most of the picnic tables, which helps when the weather is inclement.  Mosquitoes are an issue, especially as the sun goes down, but this is Wisconsin so you've got to expect that.  The place closes down at 9:00 PM in deference to the residential nature of the area, which actually is a blessing in many ways.  On weekends it's a great start to the evening, and I really don't need to be staying out that late on weeknights anymore.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Wn8NhS-L1ck6jbTjX88Kkg"}

The beer garden (bier garten?) is huge, filled with weather-beaten picnic tables, and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun. Trees insulate the place, and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as Westside Andy and the Mel Ford band. People bring their kids, their dogs, decks of cards and board games, and enjoy the excellent beer that's doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff. Bring your own food - some local joints like the Roman Candle will even deliver right to your picnic table. And if the weather's not so nice, you can visit the Bier Stube, Capital's indoor bar, which is full of dark, rich wood and nice people. I highly recommend the Capital Brewery.

Crikey - I'm losing it, I tell 'ya.\n\nNo visit to the Madison area would be complete without stopping-by the Capital Brewery.  During the spring/summer/fall months, their beer garden is phenomenal.  It's a large, trellised, open area that's sun-protected compliments of a huge blue tent cover/awning.  \n\nPicnic tables galore, it makes for an ideal location to chill with friends and family.  Bring along whatever type of food you'd like, because they don't serve food here.  Or, better yet, call one of the many local restaurants and request delivery - most of them service the brewery.  Dogs are more than welcome, as are kids. \n\nA large stage frames the eastern side of the garden; you'll find live music on most Friday and Saturday nights.  They used to show movies on Saturday nights, but I believe that has come to pass.\n\nThe staff is always excellent.  You won't find a nicer group of folks no matter how far or hard you search.  Kyle's the absolute best - the guy is unbelievably friendly, funny, and knows everything about the brews.  He often serves as the brewery tour guide, so pay attention if he suggests you try a certain brew.\n\nDuring the colder months, the indoor stube is warm and inviting.  There's a large flat screen television for game watching, and plenty of comfy seating.  The stube operates on reduced hours during the winter months, and just a heads-up that it's often times rented/reserved for private events (think holiday parties), so check their website schedule prior to planning a spur-of-the-moment visit.\n\nThe gift shop is nice, with a great selection of glasses, shirts, and other goodies.  Prices are more than reasonable.  The bathrooms are usually spotless, which is a bonus.\n\nSo... if you haven't been to the brewery, make it a priority to visit.  Stop by on a Saturday or Sunday and take the tour (it's only a couple of dollars, includes samples, and runs hourly), then spend time enjoying some of Capital's great beers.

Yes, I could save a ton of money on parts by buying items online, but as mentioned, I respect dealerships and understand the benefits of supporting local businesses.  \n\nThat said, this particular VW dealership (the Zimbrick on Century Avenue is only a VW dealer, BTW - no Acura any longer at this location) shocked me with their inability to comprehend a simple request for oil, an oil filter, and a fuel filter.\n\nI called to check the price and availability for some common, everyday maintenance items for my VW Jetta.  My Jetta has the 1.9L BRM Diesel motor (\"PD\" style), and as such has some unique requirements as identified by Volkswagen, specifically when it comes to oil.  VW mandates that you use their 505.01 approved oil in the BRM diesel motor.  Failure to do so may result in a voided or compromised warranty.\n\nSo imagine my shock when the parts guy told me to use \"any old oil\" while on the phone.  When I tried to correct him and request the 505.01 Castrol VW oil, he seemed to get a bit unnerved.\n\nI then asked about a fuel filter, and despite having told him the make, model, year, and engine type of my VW on three separate occasions, he still misquoted my filter.  I then gave him my VIN, and he was still confused.  A few minutes later, he quoted me the correct filter, but at a price that was easily 2x higher than what I would pay from any other online VW parts dealer.\n\nSo, I declined to purchase anything from this local resource, and will now have to shop online with an out-of-the-area dealership.  I'm sorry, but my confidence was shaken immediately, and I was floored by the sky high price (they quoted $60 for the filter; everyone else is $25).", "type": "review", "business_id": "uyp8kpTXKfKXvAB8HdJSAA"}

I let it ring another 15 times or so and just gave up. \n\nI don't mind having someone answer and then immediately put me on hold. It's a lot better than the nothing that I got.

And that's just the stuff I've used. \n\nThere are two different graphic novel sections: one for adults and one for kids. Finally, maybe my *most* favorite thing, is the Staff Picks section. It's mostly books but with a few DVDs too; I've found some worthy stuff there. \n\nThere are dedicated children's librarians, friendly people at the information/reference desk (with little plaques that say please interrupt us), and book returns both inside and out.

We saw the specials board had an item which was a play on the Godfather, their signature Italian roast beef sandwich, and discussed whether we'd want to try it. During all this the gentleman behind the counter remained seated but appeared to be paying attention.\n\nWhen I said we were ready to order he got up, but when I ordered a Godfather he said that they were out of Italian beef. I have worked in restaurants myself and at times you do run out of items, but I don't understand why the specials board carried an item they didn't have and more incomprehensible yet is why he would listen to us talk about the aforementioned special and never bother to mention he couldn't make one anyway. The specials board should have been blank, and more importantly, he should have told us when we came in that they were out of some ingredients.\n\nIf he had, we probably would have stayed and ordered something else, but his attitude projected total, casual indifference in serving us and getting our business.

No excuse for dirty.\n\nThe waitress was really nice, I think her name was Sarah.  She was personable and attentive.  She's the only reason I'd give this place a star at all.\n\nI ordered a Gyro sandwich.  It came with fries and a bowl of soup.  I ordered Broccoli Cheese soup.  I think if I heated up some Velveeta and added a gallon of water to it, then tossed in a bunch of dirty, uncut broccoli, I could duplicate the Sir Hobo recipe.\n\nI wish the rest of the meal was that good.  When the Gyro arrived, it reeked of rotten deer carcass, the plate was filthy and the fries were colder than Alaska in December.  I'm not joking.  The Gyro tasted so bad that I had to spit a mouthful of it into a napkin and slug down a glass of water to cleanse the horse-s--t taste from my mouth.  \n\nSarah noticed that I hadn't eaten my food, she offered to remove it from the bill with out me asking.  I would normally applaude that gesture, but some older foreign lady (I assume the owner) came over and told her not to do that.  \"I'll make you new sandwich,\" said the old lady. I declined.  I figured I couldn't choke down another bite of the garbage they call food.  I paid my 9 dollars for a lousy cup of liquid Velveeta and left.\n\nI bet the Dairy Queen across the parking lot is glad that Sir Hobo's is back open.  I wonder how many people have done what I did... walk to DQ and had an ice cream cone to try to clean the aftertaste of death and decay from my mouth.  Never again.

We love the indoor family and warm water pools. The nursery staff is excellent. I like that when we come in to drop the kids off at the nursery, they greet us by our first names.  I love the infrared sauna they recently put in. \nOne advice I would give to people who are considering of joining is that you don't have to get the most exclusive membership like gold cove, if you are only going to work out on the machines. We have gold cove, the most expensive membership which allows you to have exclusive access to outdoor water park during summer and most of the group fitness classes offered in the club but we hardly go to group fitness class and hardly go to outdoor water park. The water temperature is still cold even it is 80 degrees out. This past summer, we went to the outdoor water park maybe two- three times the most and stayed out no more than half hour. So, it really isn't worth to have a gold cove unless you know you are looking for specific classes with GC membership. \nThe parking and getting the machine to work out can be a problematic during winter months between 4:30-7:00PM. Sometime, you may have to wait 15-20 minutes for the machine to free. If that's the case, you can go sit in the sauna until some people leave. So, I would suggest go there early in the morning or late in the evening but then if you are bringing along your little ones you run into problems with daycare after nursery is closed. They have a restaurant that offers supposedly healthier food but we never had any luck with the food there. The taste is okay and price is a little bit on the high end for the amount you get.", "type": "review", "business_id": "h_lhVizdHBJOVNAIgTB3eQ"}

So I have a lot to say, but not nearly enough Yelp space in which to do it, so I shall do my best to summarize.\n\nPros\n1. Three indoor swimming pools + two jacuzzis\n2. Lots and lots of cardio equipment + 4 different weight areas\n3. Indoor soccer field, track, basketball courts, and racquetball courts\n4. Lots of classes - aerobics, swimming, spinning, etc\n5. Outdoor pools with waterpark\n6. Childcare\n\nCons\n1. Expensive membership with required 2 year contract\n2. You only have access to all the things listed above under the Pros section if you have the Gold Cove membership, which is the most expensive package.  Regardless of having the most expensive membership, you still have to pay extra for most of the classes.  \n3. If you have anything less than the Gold Cove membership, there is one older woman at the front desk, as you check in, who will look at you like you're trying to steal the tanning bed she lives in.  However, there is also a younger one with long, dark hair, who is more of an equal opportunity offender.  She'll treat you like crap, no matter what your status.\n4. If you don't have Gold Cove forget about going to the waterpark, unless you want to pay 23 dollars per person to get in.  \n5. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT bring in any of your own food.  If they catch you anywhere in the facility with so much as a pretzel stick, they will go off on you, thusly informing you that you can only consume food and beverages purchased at THEIR lounge/bar/crappy food place.  Because you know, you might be trying to smuggle in crack cocaine with your pretzels. \n6. Lounge/bar area serves you the crappiest, overpriced food you can find.  I don't know about the bar because I didn't go to a health club to drink.  \n7. Parking is a nightmare, especially in the mornings, and right around the time people are coming home from work.  While that is to be expected, the countless number of SUVs and big pick ups with something to prove, stalking people as they head to their vehicles makes for a dangerously crowded, and highly annoying situation.\n\nThere you have it.

The parking lot has so many huge dips and holes I sometimes think I am being forced to go spelunking in my car.  \n\nThe old lady greeters at the front door are my favorite part of the experience because they remind me of grandma.  But they would probably mace me if I tried to run up and give them a hug.  \n\nThey have a fabric department, which seems to be a feature that the newer, super walmarts are missing.  Unfortunately, the store is usually running a skeleton crew most of the time, so it's hard to find an employee in that section of the store who knows how to cut some fabric.  \n\nMost of the employees here are like most of the employees at any Walmart, underpaid, and overworked.  So it doesn't bother me too much when they frown at me.  I've been on the other side of the register before, so I know how soul crushing it can be.  Though, they may not be frowning at me because of that reason, they probably just know I'm an incredible dufus.  \n\nHowever, there is one employee there who is usually cashiering, and has this wonderful Russian accent.  She's also very friendly and cheery.  The other day she was telling me about growing her own basil, freezing it in ice cube trays with chicken stock, and then plopping the cubes in rice later on for flavoring.  Tricky, tricky!  \n\nAnyway, I guess I am more impressed by the larger Walmart in Monona that has the shopping cart escalators.  I could stand there all day and launch carts down that thing, it really revs up the dork in me.  \n\nBut in the meantime, if I don't feel like heading over that way I could just stop at this Walmart to get maced by the grannies and listen to cooking recipes from Nina.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tZbKiggbDGeBpGnOYk0Syw"}

We've a large amount of family and friends for this traditional celebration so I needed a place that was both Big (enough for 300+ guests), Bold (that WOW factor when they even entered the building, foyer and ballroom) and Beautiful (for a place that would accentuate my daughter and her Epic Ballgown.)\n\nI sent an email to Lake Windsor with no response.  Two weeks later I called, turns out my email was never received. See?  It pays to follow-up!

I have been thinking about my daughters 'Coming of Age' party since she was five (5) and I went into the planning stages of this event early in 2009.  Jennifer and I spoke by phone and we met up the following afternoon. She was very informative, knowledgeable, and welcoming. No one had had such an event there at Windsor so she was very excited about this one!  We read and reviewed the contract, gave her a non-refundable deposit check and we were in the booking book!\n\nMy daughter Dylilah and I reviewed the menu and decided on a buffet style lunch and the vendors I worked with (Cake, Balloons Statues, Slide Show, Lion Dancers, etc.) had no issues having access to the property the day of.\n\nIf you'd like to see how great it turned out and how beautiful Windsor (and my daughter) really is, we've got the video here: http://youtu.be/DCX7KZQCzcE?t=2m8s\n\nNo, they are not inexpensive but, you get what you pay for and truly, I'm sure Lake Windsor will take your wishes and concerns seriously and execute them into an unforgettable time as they did with us!", "type": "review", "business_id": "22UfD-4PEOgXTr6sev5McQ"}

Greens, fairways, teeboxes - all areas can be affected.\n\nDuring dry periods, like today (it rained 3 days ago), it wasn't bad and the course was in relatively good shape.  I don't know if it was the sunshine or how the rough was cut (or not cut), but it was really hard to spot a ball in areas where it should be easy.  That was frustrating. \n\nThe course layout is nice with some rolling elevation change (nothing drastic) and water in play on many holes.  A few par 4's will make you think about going around or over water for your second shot - that's always fun!\n\nSo, while not my favorite course in in the area, I will golf here often.

I thought I'd head east and come here for lunch since I didn't find anything better. Years ago, this used to be a place called Stockade and I loved it. Now it's a Badgers/Packers bar and grill. \n\nVisible from I-90, just west of Madison, there's a cheese place (Mouse Haus I believe) and warehouses for Pepsi and Walgreen's nearby. The Rodeside Grill resembles a log cabin style fort from the outside. Years ago, this place used to be called Stockade.\n\nOnce inside, it's quite spacious with high ceilings and an all wood interior, except for the tile on the floor. The whole place looks very clean, not grungy and aged like so many bars in Wisconsin. I sat down to eat at the bar. All along the bar counter, there were blurbs and excerpts of Packers and Badgers accomplishments underneath the laminated countertop. The place even had green-colored ductwork, so I knew I was deep in Packers territory.\n\nA big screen TV aired game highlights from the Packers-Saints NFL season opener from the day before. Large men with mustaches came in for lunch, typical Wisconsin body types. I kept a low profile and my Chicago origin and calmly requested the Friday fish fry special. Having traveled up north on many occasions, this wasn't the first time I was surrounded by Packer fans. It's not hard to deal with them if you don't disclose where you're from and stick to the menu items or make a positive comment about Jordy Nelson being an awesome rising star on the team.\n\nThe fish arrived in a few minutes and it came with a side of fries that were seasoned and coated - quite tasty in fact. Coleslaw is also a can't-miss item north of Illinois and this place has it right too. I found the meal quite enjoyable. The bartender got me another iced tea and then spent a few more minutes of admiring the place. The Packers highlights gave way to NASCAR on the TV, but I was on my way, 150 miles from Chicago once again.\n\nWhile I went for the fish, Rodeside also has some good burgers, from what I saw around me at lunch that day.

Food trashed for no reason, and potentially the correct order (or they plated it incorrectly, twice). \n\n*Their idea of chimichangas are really just bigger-than-average flautas; they were open-ended and have no filling aside from the meat.

I don't know the east side of town all that well but I do know that I like the Ale Asylum A LOT.  I seem to be successful in getting everyone to go there about 25% of the time; otherwise we end up at the Sports Pub.  I've spent quite a few nights here and I can't really say I've ever had a good time.  If I could I'd rate this 2.5 stars, because really this place isn't that bad.  It's just that there are so many places with better beer, nicer bartenders, friendlier crowds and better food.  Every time I've gone to the Sports Pub there have been good aspects of my experience, but something always goes wrong and I leave with a bad impression of the place.  \n\nThe first time, several years back, I remember having a really tasty burger, but the pitcher of Capital had little bits of gunk floating in it and the bartender tried to blame that on me.  That was enough for me to cross it off my list, but my friend really likes the place and I've been back multiple times since.  Last weekend, for example, we went for the second half of the Badger game.  It was crowded to be sure, but the service was good and my sandwich was pretty decent.  Unfortunately this was marred by the fact that we could not see a television from where the table was positioned, which kind of defeated the purpose of going to a sports bar.  I also got into a ridiculous argument with some drunk at the bar over something trivial, and I spent the rest of the afternoon hearing him loudly talk about me from across the bar.  Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.\n\nThe menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.  There's usually a Capital and Spotted, and aside from the aforementioned incident I haven't had a major problem with quality.  There's a foosball table near the door where I once schooled a plastered townie five games in a row before hubris got the better of me and I was resounding beaten by his girlfriend.  There are outdoor volleyball courts and leagues during the summer.  I'm sure that if I lived near this place I'd probably find it a nice local hangout.  But I don't, and every time I've made the trip over from Middleton I end up regretting the experience.  I just can't recommend the place, though I'm pretty sure that I'll find myself back there in the not so distant future.  Maybe then it won't be so bad, but I'm not holding my breath.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qQvpS262VPEHKZvM6j5uhQ"}

He really asked me how I liked my hair cut, what tools to use, etc., since I know \"my hair best.\"  My hair can be a little difficult to work with, so I really appreciate that he took the time to ask.\n\nAnother great bonus: 1 week guarantee on the cut.  If I didn't like it, I could come back for a redo or even get my money back.  Got the cut on Monday and was back on Friday for some tweaking, which I'm glad I did, but even better to know the offer was there.  \n\n$23 for a haircut is a wonderful deal, but beware: CASH ONLY!  They also do styling, hair color, perms, nails, waxing and make up.  They are an Aveda salon (but not a concept salon).\n\nI haven't decided yet to keep seeing Dan, or back to Robyn at Cha Cha, but I would recommend Rebecca Lynn Studio to anyone looking for a great deal on great service.

I had an \"Island Paradise\" - Pineapple and coconut complemented with pomegranate grenadine and a splash of Sprite.  It was very good.\n\nWe ordered a quesadilla appetizer and it was pretty tasty.  There was plenty of chicken, cheese, and vegetables between the tortillas and the portion was just right for us.\n\nWe decided that we would both order something different so that we could share and try other foods on the menu.\n\nI ordered the \"El Cubano\" a traditional Cuban sandwich, made with ham, cheese, roasted pork, pickle and mustard all pressed inside two slices of Cuban bread.  It was average at best.  My friend ordered the BBQ Cheddar Burger and it was excellent.  The burger is just as it sounds, consisting of a bun, beef patty, BBQ sauce cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomatoes, with fried onions.  He gave me half and it was a lot better than the sandwich I ordered.  I did not even finish my half of the Cuban.  My sandwich did come with sweet potato chips which were pretty good.  I am not usually a fan of sweet potato but found myself munching on these chips.\n\nI don't know much about Jimmy Buffett, but the name of this place is actually the title of one of his songs.  There are 38 locations in 17 states, all in places very far from Hawaii.  Maybe it isn't supposed to be like Hawaii, but I feel like it looks like what Hawaii might be envisioned by someone who has never been.  There was no version of the burger made with pineapple slices and teriyaki sauce...but maybe that's because Buffett supposedly wrote \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" in the Carribbean...which changes everything.  Maybe that's why they serve the Cubano, which was still subpar at best.\n\nOverall, the food was satisfactory.  If I am ever in town again or happen to pass by a Cheeseburger in Paradise, I might go back because the drinks are good and the burgers are yummy.  It is a decent meal that won't break your wallet, but take a hint by the restaurant's name and order a cheeseburger.  WWJBD...what would Jimmy Buffett do?

Instead, all they serve up here is hamburgers with fancy names.   Every burger I have ever ordered here has been lesser than any burger at any  greasy spoon or family restaurant.   \nI was hoping they would have some steak fries instead of the usual basic fries.  Nope.   The burgers are just that, basic burgers with a sauce to match the fancy name.   What chef dreamed up these recipes?   I doubt it was a chef.  Probably some person that said, \"good enough, let's go make some money\".\nOur burgers yesterday were about 10 bucks each and just basic burgers that should have cost about 4 bucks.   The meat didn't have any distinctive flavor and was rather skimpy, the sauce was not complimentary to the sandwich and the bun was generally regular too.   At least the bun was fresh.  \nI would only recommend this place to my Republican friends because they have no ability to think for themselves anyway and might actually like the place.\nIf you're looking for paradise you won't find it here.

Food came and the fries were cold.  Told the waiter we wanted new fries and he obliged.  The burger was nothing special.  Should have been half the price we paid.  Then, after I'm half way done with the burger, the waiter returns and says he checked with the manager and we could get a Corona for $2.50.  Too late.  By this time, I just wanted to leave.  The place was not busy at all, I'm not sure what took him so long to check with the manager about that.  I hate these theme restaurants and this trip just served to solidify my beliefs that gimmicky restaurants usually do not have good food.

I was greeted by a revolving door that looked like the windows hadn't been cleaned since the last time Jimmy Buffet was in town.  We were seated at our booth, but before I could slide on in I asked if they would wipe the liquid off of the seat.  I went to the bathroom and washed my hands (the bathroom is another story) When I came back, the liquid was still on the seat of the booth.  The waitress just sluffed off the fact i was agitated by the lack of customer service.  Seriously.  How hard is it to wipe off the booth.\n\nThe food was decent.  Nothing great, but ok.  Portions are weak however.  You'll probably have to venture across the lot to McDonalds for a Big Mac afterward if you want to be full.  A Big Mac would probably be as flavorful as the burgers served here. \n\nWhat irked me about my trip here was the service.  First was the lack of caring when it came to the booth's cleanliness.  Second, I never got a refill on my soda.  For $2.49, I'm sure jimmy could afford another glass of soda.  It took our waitress nearly 10 minutes to collect come back with our bill.  It was like they took my debit card and walked to my bank instead of swiping it to collect payment.\n\nThey get two stars because I didn't have to choke down the food.  However I think I'd rather get in my old car, drive to McDonalds, and risk the chance I get explosive diarrhea before climbing into a sailboat and pointing it toward Cheeseburger In Paradise.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1hBOR97oX5Xph3J8Tdob7w"}

Since they were supposed to close at 11:00 pm we figured it was enough time to eat. When we walked in there were only three other tables of people, one of which was a couple that came in right before us. We waited at the host stand for 3 minutes and finally were greeted by the bartender. He took us to our table and told us our waitress would be with us shortly.  \n\nThe only server left (female, dark brown hair) came over and rushed her greeting by acting annoyed that we were there. She took our order and ran off to start doing the close prep. 5 minutes later she came back to our table and said that the bar was closing (10:30 pm) and that we couldn't get frozen drinks. She asked if we were interested in ordering another type of drink but we declined. She then acted annoyed that we didn't want something other than water! \n\nOur food quickly came out and it was WONDERFUL (thankfully) but our waitress never came back to check on us. I ran out of water and just as I was putting my napkin down she came over with another glass. At that time we asked for our check. We were so mad about the quality of the service that we just wanted to get out of there. We ended up walking out the door at 11:00 pm on the dot! \n\nMy partner and I always tip a min of 20% but often if we like someone we will tip way above. Our service was so terrible that we left her a 15% tip with a note explaining how uncomfortable she made our visit. If she had one ounce of sweetness to her we would've given her 20% BUT she was cold and distant. I understand wanting to get off of work but at least fake a smile and a personality. \n\nI will not be coming back. Yes, the food was amazing BUT bad service equals a no go in my book. Also, why close the bar 30 minutes early???? The drinks are around $8 so do the math on how much you are losing if our table would've ordered 2-4 drinks.

The crust was explosive, the ingredients were pleasing  (I went to a boutique, Sicilian-personally-owned pizza place in Madison last week - - which I charitably did not rate on Yelp - -  where the otherwise-droolingly-pretty and well-assembled aggregations somehow tasted plain and  DULL - - you have to BUY good basic INGREDIENTS).\n\nThe truly odd thing about Benvenutos are the aesthetics.  It is situated on a desperate strip mall, with a hideous bland exterior, that makes you think it is some pretend restaurant, living on pretentions alone.  The pretentions continue as you go to the giant counter.  And then there is this quasi-industrial interior, with huge industrial ceiling-fanned ceilings, cute semi-Vegas-italian- buffet faux-italain scrawlings on the strange pompous facades, all amidst these massive spatial proportions that are wholly intimidating, and make you think you are either in some very, very SPECIAL hallowed unknown reclusive monastery purveying mama's most lustrous home-style concoctions (which you know isn't true), or you are in the most prepostrous strip-mall farce that has ever been created\n\nIt's a little of each, but amidst this aggregation of disparate elements, the proof is in the pizza, and the pizza is incredibly good.

The gals hosting the party had planned it with the restaurant and had a fixed menu with three options available for everyone. It worked out really nicely for our party and the food was pretty tasty. I don't remember exactly what I got but I do remember enjoying the boxed up leftovers when I was hungover the next morning. \n\nThe service was very good considering we were a boisterous group of about 20 ladies. I was having an ice tea craving that day and think I went through about 8 glasses of the stuff while we were there. The two waitresses helping our table we spot on.

They've got your fresh baked bread with olive oil, a wide variety of parmesan filled or topped pastas, a bunch of red wine that doesn't technically go with your meal, and some ridiculously cheesy music that really only should be played in a movie when someone is riding a gondola in Venice. Sometimes this is exactly what you want, a definite dad pleaser for my family. Sometimes you want something that actually comes from Italy, which probably couldn't be further from the menu here.\n\nTonight I had a six ounce sirloin with some seasoned veggies. The sirloin was medium rare as requested, but pretty charred on the outside. I suppose ill stick to pasta next time, it's what they do the most of. I also tried their chili which was good but had no kick at all. Perhaps they meant minestrone? The best part of the meal was the fresh bread. I mean that not as knock to the meal and more as a compliment to the bread. It was seasoned really well and had a nice hardness to the outside to give it an awesome texture. Great starter!\n\nThe service was about as good as you can get from a restaurant that had their waiters write on your table in classy crayon. The place looks nicer than a Chilis, but when they start the meal by demonstrating your tablecloth is actually a roll of paper it sets the tone for a pretty laid back meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ybkWtM1ZnT2ewuquj3A9KQ"}

While changing my clothes I heard a mans voice.\n\nI frantically search for a way to lock the door, but there is not lock! The door flies open! There is a man standing there looking me up & down, smiling at me! I was trying on dresses so I was completely undressed. I went into shock, screaming you can be in here!!

I came out of the dressing room yelling \"there is a man in the dressing room\"!\n\nThe clerks told him he shouldn't be in there, but weren't that concerned about what just happened to me! The only person who seem to care was a customer, she appeared to be shocked about the situation I left the store in tears.\n\nThe next day I called the manager. She didn't think it was a big deal! I said \"why don't you have locks on the dressing room doors? You could have prevented this horrible situation!\" She had no response to my question. She said she would send me a $50.00 gift card, but I received no apology, how insulting!\n\nCome to find out not a single dressing room in Boston Store East Town, not even lingerie dept has a lock on the door. I believe this is every woman's worst nightmare!\n\nAren't we supposed to feel safe in a store while in a state of undress? I wish it had not happened to me, but it did. I would like to bring awareness to other women. I will always make sure the dressing room has a lock before I enter and undress.\n\nI spoke with store manager several times. I let her know I spend thousand of dollars every year at Boston Store. She didn't seem to care. I asked to speak with upper management, she will not give phone number I gave her mine. To date no one has called.\n\nI feel I was stalked at Boston Store that day. He may have known there were no locks and followed me into dressing room.

I attended the dinner with three friends, one of whom happens to be a professional fisherman from Alaska. He fishes primarily for cod and salmon, and supplies several very well known restaurants with his bounty. His fish is top notch and without compare - truly great stuff. \n\nHe wanted to try Wilson's, as he doesn't supply them with fish and is always looking for opportunities to expand his distribution footprint in and around the area.\n\n+ Huge space. Shockingly huge - rectangular in shape, the building is at least 4-5 times deeper than it is wide. \n+ Bar runs the entire length of the building\n+ Nice selection of taps and bottles available\n+ Was quite surprised to find Abita Strawberry on tap\n\n+ Tons of televisions; our high-top had its own TV\n- Very noisy due to all of the televisions going\n\n- All tables were dirty; staff wasn't too good about wiping down after people left\n- Our server was quite gruff, not terribly helpful, largely absent, and forgot to bring refills of drinks and waters\n\nSo... all of that stuff aside, let's talk about the fish.\n\nTwo options for fish: 3-piece or 5-piece deep-fried cod. No baked cod, and no other fish varietals. \n\n+ The cooking area is in plain view of the entire restaurant\n- You'll leave smelling like a deep fryer\n- We watched as our fries sat and languished on plates for a good 5+ minutes while the fish cooked\n- We watched as our completed plates loitered in the cooking area for another 5+ minutes after the fish was done; our server was busy running around helping other tables while the fish sat...and sat... and sat... \n- Before we were finished eating, our cranky server began clearing a space directly behind us so that they could set-up for karaoke. That's all well and good, but the guy kept bumping stuff into us (the bar stools don't have backs)... he was like a bull in a china shop.\n\n+ Batter on the cod was delicious, if not quite salty. Violet L is a salt fan, and she even commented that it was overly salty\n- The cod itself was dry, slightly chewy, and meh. My fisherman friend said it was \"jerky-like.\" He was, however, quite impressed (as were all of us) by how well the batter clung to the cod. The two components were very well bonded.\n- I thought the batter had a taste similar to KFC's original coating - salty with a bit of pepper. I suspect that those who truly enjoy this fish fry are mostly in love with the batter.\n\nI didn't try the slaw; the roll was your typical cafeteria-style white bread roll.\n\n+ Inexpensive; four of the 3-piece cod dinners with a round of drinks was $34.\n\nI'm not sure why Madison Fish Fry likes this place so much. Perhaps we got a bad round of cod, along with bad service. Fish that sits after being cooked never bodes well... and while I believe in second chances, the overall experience left me quite sour, so it may be difficult to return in a timely manner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zAsxPh3h9xMQnSDGl41kSg"}

I drove around for close to 20 minutes until I found something and though the spot I found ended up being pretty decent I did have to circle the block for 20 minutes before I found it.  They have a parking lot in the back but it is really small and was full before I got there. \n\nAdditionally, I tried to get a drink before the show and tried to hit up a bar but there were no good bars in the area.  The bar I found, the name escapes me now, was cash only and looked so old.   With that said however, they did make a pretty good vodka gimlet.\n\nThe Barrymore Theatre itself was not any better.

I had to walk a little, and in the wintertime that kind of sucks, but I would never pay for parking in this neighborhood.\n\nMy favorite part of this venue is the 'star' curtain on the ceiling.

But in the last few years, other venues in Madison have really stepped up their game, and the Barrymore doesn't seem to care about keeping up with its contemporaries.\n\nIts use of social media is near-archaic. The venue doesn't make an effort to create or even update pages for individual events, and good luck if you get any indication that a show is on track to sell out. And perhaps it's just my personal taste, but the Barrymore used to bring in excellent music acts on a much more regular basis. Now it just caters to the aging-hippie population of the neighborhood, preferring to fill its schedule with predictable offerings about far-left-leaning politics. These events don't offend my own political views, but they're often dull and serve as nothing more than an echo chamber for people who want their beliefs perpetually reaffirmed. They sell more tickets that way, so I'm not sure I can blame them for the strategy, but  I hardly ever like the shows there. Also, the tickets are 2-3 times more expensive than the tickets usually are at other live entertainment venues in town.\n\nThe building itself isn't falling into disrepair, like the Orpheum is (heartbreakingly, I might add), but areas of infrastructure could certainly benefit from attention. There is no public WiFi, and you'll be hard-pressed to get cell phone reception, even in the balcony. I do appreciate that the open dance area is slanted a bit so that we vertically-challenged folks have a chance to see, but if you want to be able to sit and see the acts, the balcony is your best bet. It's not often open, however, especially for shows that haven't sold a ton of tickets. I don't recall this being a problem at prior events, but at the show I attended last night, there were constant problems with microphone feedback, often necessitating acrobatics by the band itself. The tap beer selection is good, but that's pretty standard in this town. Bottled beer selection pales in comparison to other venues, and the liquor and wine options are slim pickings. The bar is cash-only. The only ATM in the place charges a $4 fee for each use, so if you need to withdraw cash, make sure to get enough in one go. The line can be enormous, and often is bisected by people exiting and entering the theater. The bathrooms are fairly clean and well-stocked, although I've used them on more than one occasion to discover that they were out of soap, necessitating the use of their hand sanitizer instead.  Also, the saloon-style doors are an easy way to get smacked in the face entering and exiting the bathroom, so exercise plenty of caution around them. The bathrooms are so tiny that the lines are formed outside the doors. They also don't sell earplugs, so make sure you bring your own.\n\nBottom line: in the rare event that they have a show I want to see, I'll go, but I make sure to bring plenty of cash, my own earplugs, and my plastic Barrymore cups (drinks are 50 cents cheaper when you remember to bring your cups back).", "type": "review", "business_id": "f5ntGOT9_0pCdeUaUVi9cg"}

I absolutely love this place and everything on the menu.  When I was a kid the best times were when my father would take an afternoon delivery to the east side and swing by NOTO on the way back.  It was always such a great surprise when my sister and I would be called in for dinner, and right away you could smell those spices!  Those are some of my favorite memories, and to this day I get a rush of excitement just walking in to the place when I get that first waft...  It really is the best outside of the Gulf.\n\nI really can't even start on what my favorites are because every time I pick something off the menu it becomes my new favorite.  The po' boys are without exception great.  The roast beef was my first love, and I keep coming back to this one.  The French bread is perfect - crisp and the perfect texture for the sandwich.  It took me a while to try the fried oyster po' boy - I was not so adventurous as a kid - but after trying this I see why this is my mother's favorite.  The Gulf shrimp and the fried chicken are incredible.  This place is a 5 star easily on the strength of the po' boys alone, but the rest of the menu is not to be skipped.  The jambalaya is great for those that can't take too much heat, and even better with a bit of Tabasco for those that can.  The shrimp creole - HOO BOY!  Spicy but not excessive, it has enough heat to get you sweating and the flavors are spot on.  Same for the shrimp etouffee.  The red beans & rice with double sausage is my all-time favorite comfort food.  Most of the time I can't make up my mind, so I hit up the Mardi Gras combo, which gives you all three.  Perfection!  And it all comes with a piece of cornbread to finish it all off.  \n\nI've only been to the Fordem location, though there is another on Monroe Street.  I'm certain that had I not graduated prior to this location opening I would have made it a regular destination.  As it is, I love coming down Sherman then Fordem, and you're suddenly right there looking at the mural on the side of the building.

What an awesome little find!\n\nAfter reading some of the reviews, I wanted to try a little bit of everything. The woman at the counter suggested we try the Mardi Gras Combo and the popular Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich. I wanted to try the dirty rice and was told that I could substitute the regular rice in the Combo for dirty rice. Yes, please!\n\nFirst, I'd like to clarify that the sandwich is NOT as big as other reviews may make it out to be. It's a standard French roll with a standard amount of fillings BUT the flavors are admittedly some of the best I've ever had. The juxtaposition of creamy, tangy sauce with the crunchy, juicy shrimp combined with the fresh lettuce will have you swooning for more.\n\nOn to the combo... What a cornucopia (nods to Candice G.) of beautifully tasty french creole goodness all nestled magically in compartmentalized order without any compartments in the take-out box. It traveled several miles successfully in the manner as well. The warnings of the menu and lady at the counter on the spiciness of the dirty rice and shrimp creole were accurate. It was a flavorful, creeping sort of spice that increased with each bite. Absolutely fantastic.\n\nThe name \"take-out\" is rather misleading because there is ample seating inside the place and many interesting jazz memorabilia to peruse over while eating so eat-in instead of taking-out as the name suggests.\n\nI'll definitely be making a stop here again whenever I'm in the Madison area for some good ol' N'Orleans style cookin'.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cpGv6ES2hzPCtCUQgipwXw"}

Don't come to Pedro's in search of authentic Mexican food.

I would suggest avoiding most of the menu, which is essentially Tex-Mex T.V. dinner-type fare, except with molten cheese-drowned portions that could feed a T-Rex.  I would suggest, instead, the carnitas fajitas: the pork is very tender and flavorful, and the sauteed vegetables are tasty.  Not authentic--but perfectly fine.  They do have a good Tuesday/Thursday margarita special, though the drinks are too sweet for my taste.  I met my S.O. at Pedro's: hence the extra star.

My Guinness tasted just like water, I suspect it was watered down. Our service was super slow. We were there for over 30 minutes before we received chips and salsa. The chips were hot but they needed salt. Their salsa tasted like ketchup. Once we ordered, again our food took forever. My cousin asked for sour cream and waited another 20 minutes for it. My food was ok. The tamale was actually pretty good. It needed spice though.\n\nThe kicker was when the manager, Brett, started changing the channels shortly after halftime! We asked the waitress what was going on. We came for a badger game. Our menus had badger specials, FB also listed their badger specials. Having just received our food... Yes it took two quarters, we couldn't relocate to another establishment. Apparently, there was a UFC fight on. We asked to speak to management, this is when we met Brett.\n\nWe asked about the game. He refused to turn the game back on stating that they paid $2000.00 for the UFC fight and they were going to show it. I looked around at the sea of red and asked him what his current demographic/ customer base thought of missing the second half of the game. He again referenced the cost. His solution was to have us move tables in the middle of our dinner to be in view of a smaller tv with no sound! \n\nWorst of all was when I told him we wouldn't be returning because of this he said,\"Ok.\" \n\nHe clearly doesn't care about his customers!

This had been my go-to place for beans-and-rice Mexican in Madison for the better part of two decades, and I had converted my wife into a Pedro's fan. I'd had past or present Madison residents take issue with my insistence that Pedro's was a great casual dinner place, but I took that as part and parcel of Madison's legendary pretentiousness toward anything that's not \"edgy,\" such as old-school Americanized Mexican food.\n\nUnfortunately, it turns out any snobbery against Pedro's may be justified. My wife and I stopped in for the first time in 3 or 4 years and we were both sorely disappointed with our experience. The burrito is smaller than it used to be -- I suppose that's how they've been able to hold the line on prices so the size reduction is probably justified -- but my wife's fajitas were chewy, and both dishes lacked that \"kick\" that they used to have. Our quesadilla appetizer arrived luke-warm and was nearly rock-hard within minutes.\n\nThe premises haven't changed in the nearly 20 years I've been eating there and it's starting to show its age. Service was adequate, no more no less. which would be fine if everything else up to par.  In short, Pedro's lacks that extra spark that used to make it worth a special stop when visiting or passing through town. Not to mention the Mexican cuisine options have exploded in Madison in the last 20 years, so one would think Pedro's would need to step up their game rather than rest on their laurels.

What came to the table was a bloody, raw steak -- not rare, mind you, but raw -- and eggs with a translucent, inedible crust around the outer edge.\n\nSome of that crust ended up in one of the other orders, which was scrambled eggs with biscuits and gravy.

Was it the same substance as the translucent crust? Was it a string from a hairnet? Was it a human hair? When I pulled it from my mouth, it split in two and curled up like elastic might curl up.\n\nOur server was appropriately apologetic and tried to make things okay -- the service was good, but the food was absolutely horrid!\n\nThe manager asked us how our dinner was when we went to pay, so we told her.

When my friend also complained that his berry dessert was only half of what it should be (completely deflated and only half the bowl), she didn't offer to take it back or anything, just kind of laughed it off.

You can order in advanced (at least one hour ahead of time), or you can ask for a cab to be sent as soon as one is available. The online system also allows you to track your cab (once it has been assigned to you) and gives you an estimated time of arrival (fabulous!). \n\nSide note: I noticed that calling the number they have listed on their website is a huge pain in the ass and the hold time is always longer than their estimate. As such, I really appreciate the new ordering system because it allows me to bypass the wait time on the phone and to avoid speaking to operators who sometimes have trouble understanding what I am asking for. \n\nWhen the cab arrives at your address, a text is sent to your phone and you are able to communicate with the driver via text (in case of delay/change of plans, etc.).\n\nAlso, since you enter your credit card number into the online ordering system, once you get to your destination and are ready to 'pay' for the ride, all you have to do is sign a piece of paper and write in the amount of tip you want to leave, and everything is set. There is no need to pull out your wallet and risk leaving it in the cab or dropping it on the street!\n\nThumbs up, Union Cab! I'm in love with all this technology!! \n\nPS. If you get cab #59, you are in for a treat. The driver is a real sweetheart and a great conversationalist.

He has no problem with Surlys, he said, and he'd build me one if that's what I wanted. But he made me do some research first. And he asked me what I'd be using the bike for. Earl and I talked for about an hour that day, and I left the shop with a few of Earl's suggestions: bikes and companies I had never heard of or considered (Handsome Cycles, Soma, All-City, to name a few). \n\nI still wanted that Surly, though, so I went back. \"Build me a Surly!\" Earl said he would. But I'm short (barely five-foot-two), so Earl wanted to make sure I'd actually fit on a Surly before ordering one. He called a previous customer and asked her to bring in her Surly. He hooked the bike up to the trainer, watched me pedal, told me to shift, told me to break, told me to actually ride the bike, and I did. So, he ordered me the surly. \n\nThe whole process - sitting down, ordering the bike (the Cross-Check), picking the color (wonderful lime green), selecting the seat and pedals and fenders and, and, and - took about twenty minutes. The building of the bike took exactly a week. And it's a beautiful bike. Sleek and clean and fast and light. Put together expertly. Adjusted at least three times (Can you raise the seat? Can you lower the seat? Can you pull the handlebars forward? Can you pull the seat forward?) the day I picked it up. Happily. \n\nIt was a dream, building this bike with Revolution. Not once did I feel pressured by Earl or the rest of the crew at Revolution. Not once did I feel belittled, talked down to, or laughed at. Not once did I feel that my dream bike wasn't cool enough, worthy enough, or good enough to build. I had a bike in mind, and Earl told me to think about it. I thought about it, and Earl told me they could do it. And they did. Professionally, quickly, expertly.

Really.\n\nFor those of you that take the good time to read my mediocre reviews, you'll know that I recently bought a fat bike. And I love it. Really, really love it.\n\nBut, I don't particularly enjoy the amount of water and crud those huge tires sling around. After my last ride, it felt like I was carrying around an extra 10-lbs of salty water weight, primarily in my bike shorts. Memories of a dirty diaper came to mind... \n\nSo, I set about looking for fenders. I visited several bike stores in the area, none had what I was looking for in stock. So, I went online and ordered a set from Amazon. Who, eventually e-mailed me a \"whoops, sorry, those aren't in stock after all\" message. Curses!\n\nThen I remembered that Revolution was just around the corner from my house, so I quick raced over to see if they had a set of fenders. And they did! Win!!\n\nBut... they were installed on a bike that was on the show floor. Fail!!\n\nI inquired if they had extra fenders in stock - nope. \n\nI inquired if they would be interested in selling the ones from the show floor bike - yep!\n\nWin again!!\n\nAnd, because the fenders had been \"used\" (for one ride), they gave me an unnecessary, but greatly appreciated discount. \n\nTalk about nice guys. Thank you!! \n\nGreat selection of parts and accessories, as well as bikes of all shapes and sizes. I will be back. I promise!", "type": "review", "business_id": "QMWdcByvCYCrs7-IQyr26w"}

I continued to be friendly to the Bartender as I know the type and he was tipped $3 for the drinks.  While we got down off our bar stools he did say 'thank you, enjoy your meals.'\n\nOur waitress was Tasha and she was very pleasant; we ordered the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and chatted in between watching basketball and Men's gymnastics on one of their many TV's.   I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with the works (hold the cheese) and he ordered two (2) trios; one for now and one for later.\n\nThe food was good, but the fries were sparse and non-crispy while they were seasoned OK.  He had another Spotted Cow and we cashed out.\n\nAll in all another nice afternoon at Applebee's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JdCFcgw4yk4M1ZRhAhBIag"}

It is a city-owned course on the northeast side of Madison, south of the airport.  Most of the course is situated amidst low-lying wetlands, while on the back nine a couple of holes rise up on a ridge along Anderson Avenue.  It is an fairly easy course to walk, except that the proximity to water does mean a good amount of mosquitoes.  The recent rains led to a lot of flooding on the course, but I played last weekend and much of the course is back in playable condition.  I especially like the Bridges since the course can either reward you or punish you, but there always seems to be a bit of both.  Other courses are either too hard or too easy (mostly too hard) but the Bridges is the kind of course where after being embarrassed on a deceptively difficult par three you find yourself in position to birdie a par four that initially looked impossible.  It's enough of a challenge to keep you coming back without demoralizing you, and this makes it about the most fun of the courses in the area. \n\nThe major downside to the Bridges is the proximity to the airport.  Most of the course is right on the flight path for landing jets, and this is distracting at first.  Once you've played a round or two you learn to time your drives or putts, and Dane County Regional isn't exactly O'Hare.  Another potential problem is that this course can and will eat a lot of balls if like me you tend toward inaccuracy.  The vegetation in the O.B. areas is thick reedy wetland stuff, so just go ahead and consider that ball lost.  Lastly, the course can get very crowded and play tends to slow.  However, since I prefer to walk this usually works in my favor.  For some these drawbacks are a deal-breaker, but given the crowds on any given weekend I have to assume that this is a minority opinion.\n\nThe price is very reasonable - from $22 to $37 walking 18 depending on the time.  There is a twilight special where after 6:00 PM you can golf as much as you would like for $10.  The only problem with this is that a lot of people get in line for this and the rate of play is pretty slow.  The bar and grill in the clubhouse is one of my favorites of the city-owned courses.  The bar is well stocked and they usually have a couple of decent taps.  The last time I was there I enjoyed the new Capital Prairie Gold from a frosty mug.  You can always count on getting a can of Capital out on the course as well.  The menu is surprisingly broad and well-made.  The wraps are a satisfying end to the round, as are the sandwiches and the appetizers.  You can call in an order as you make the turn and it will be ready at the clubhouse, which is perfect for when only one or two of the foursome are eating.  Several of my friends have attended banquets or luncheons held here and have said these are well done too.  I think that top to bottom, the Bridges has about the best layout of the city-owned courses and is my personal favorite.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wls7FRMgIn8VlK1ji5Ms5g"}

You're right by the airport, so you'll see all sorts of interesting things - low flying planes taking off or landing, apache helicopters doing their thing, and jet fighters doing their routes.  While that's not golfing, it's pretty interesting to check out during your \"good walk gone bad\".\n\nThe course itself is nice.  None of the holes stand out as memory-makers, but there's some character along the way and some decisions to be made.  There's some water on the course, but only really a threat on a couple holes (#1 and #9, notably).  The rest appears to be for show - like behind the green or to the side of the green.  Most folks aren't going to put one in the drink there, but I'm sure it happens.\n\nAs a west-sider, I'm not fond of the drive to a course that is so close to me.  Getting through or around Madison and the lakes isn't always easy, so timing is key.  Plan your tee times accordingly, especially if you're golfing during the week.  Getting in or out around rush hour will take longer.\n\nThe Bridges will run specials, so check those out before you head out.  A round can be had, especially in the spring or fall, for around $25.  It's not a great walking course - the distance between one green and the next tee box can be quite a hike.  If you don't mind the extra walking, save money and skip the cart.  The course is pretty flat and you won't get wiped out by hills.  It will take longer to walk, but on a quiet day that can be pretty nice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wls7FRMgIn8VlK1ji5Ms5g"}

Their menu ranged from McSingles to McDoubles to even McTriples!! They also had a dollar menu consisting of items costing $1.07 after tax. \n\nI decided to go with their house special, The Big Mac, and their seasonal Chicken \"McNugget\" Pieces.\n\nWhen I opened up my box of chicken nuggets, the pale-golden/yellow skin indicated that it had just came out of the storage unit next to the fryer. \n \nAs the freshness evaporated with every bite, I really began to taste all the other kinds of meat that went into making the nuggets. I think I even tasted some pork, but don't take my word for it. \n\nOh my God and then you have the dipping sauces! These little containers held the perfect blend of artificial sweetener and manufactured taste  \n\nAs I eagerly unwrapped my Big Mac, I was slightly disappointed to find that it wasn't as advertised (the picture on the display made it seem a lot bigger!!). Oh well.\n\nI would really like to commend the chef on making the buns just how I like them, extremely soggy. I was even more impressed that the soggy, limp buns were able to maintain their round form. This is some pretty advanced cooking technique!!\n\nAnyways, as I bit into my Big Mac, the first thing I tasted was the mayo. Actually, it was the only thing I tasted, but it was some damn good mayo. \n\nFinally, if you're watching your waistline, they have a plethora of drink options. Choices like Diet Coke, Diet Coke Zero, Sugar-free Diet Coke Zero, etc... ensures that there's a perfect diet drink for everyone. \n\nPS: Perfect date spot for Valentine's Day.

Alas, the fish is unreal and the beer selection rivals many (if not most) of Madison's finest.\n\nDetailed Review:\nThe Fish Fry Fanatics stumbled into Dexter's Pub this past Friday and decided to give their fish fry a shot.  The menu selection is vast - we counted at least 6 or 7 solid fish fry options, from shrimp to Lake Perch to Walleye.  \n\nWe put our name in for a table, and were told it would be a 35-40 minute wait, so we ordered some of our customary Old Fashioneds.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that the bartenders muddle their Old Fashioneds, but were disappointed by the inclusion of a huge chunk of orange.  I'm sorry to say, but a Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour should *not* include half-of-an-orange as garnish.  \n\nRegardless, the Old Fashioned was solid - very good, actually.  So much so that when we ordered a second round and requested they drop the orange, it wasn't a problem.  Dexter's recovered nicely, and as luck would have it, our table became available soon after we grabbed round 2 of drinks. \n\nWe immediately ordered cheese curds, salad, and soup.  I went with the vegetable garden soup; others at the table went with chili and salad.  The soup and salads arrived within seconds; the soup was good - not great, but good - and it could've been a little warmer.  I'm told the chili was good as well - not life altering, but good.\n\nThe waiter came back to take our dinner order: two orders of beer battered cod, an order of lake perch, and an order of shrimp.  He said he'd be back in 10 minutes with our fish.  \n\nNearly an hour later, we flagged down a waitress for: refills on our drinks, and to inquire about our curds and fish.  She apologized profusely... curds came out a few minutes later - apparently they forgot about us.  The only benefit to being forgotten was that we had plenty of time to read the beer menu, which features a nice selection of craft beers from microbreweries - Dexter's doesn't strike me as a place that would feature such a wide selection of unique beers, but I guess it goes to prove that you can never judge a book by its cover.  \n\nCurds were excellent - not your typical \"from the bag\" curds, which was a nice surprise.  They were breaded and featured a mild white cheese; they were cooked perfectly.\n\nFish arrived within minutes, and it was well worth the wait.  The cod was phenomenal.  Three huge pieces with a mound of fries - now that's what we're talkin' about.  The batter was light, crisp, and flavorful.  The fish was thick, meaty, and perfectly flavored.  I loved every single bite of it.\n\nI also sampled the Lake Perch and shrimp - both of which were excellent as well.

There was an awesome mix of people there, which is always a good sign for me. They had all sorts of games playing on the multiple tvs (not just basketball, hooray!) and my boyfriend was delighted to note that they have shuffleboard.\n\nWe were seated immediately (pretty good for a Friday night) and placed our drink orders. My boyfriend got a Great Lakes Irish Red something or other, and I ordered a Pyramid Winter Ale, which wasn't all that great. I personally wish that they had some more local stuff on the beer menu, but aside from that, I can't really complain about the selection.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered beer battered cod with carrot soup, and my boyfriend ordered a burger with chili garlic fries. Our food was AMAZING. This is hands down the best fish fry I've had outside of da nortwoods, definitely the best I've had in Madison so far. The soup was interesting but delicious - kind of spicy with a hint of cilantro. I didn't try my boyfriend's burger, but the chili garlic fries were awesome. I'm someone who believes that there is no such thing as too much garlic, though, so they might be a bit much for less of a garlic lover.\n\nI am so stoked to have found a great fish fry place so close to our house.

However, when we went back a month or so later, we had a horrible experience.  We had to wait nearly 45 minutes for our food and then when we got it- it was terrible.  My boyfriend had the garlic chili fries and they arrived not only COLD, but DOUSED in disgusting grease- they were inedible.  We mentioned it to the waitress and she offered to bring a new order, but it turned out the new order was just as terrible as the first one.  I had the roast beef sandwich and it was horrible- very dry and bland.  To her credit, the waitress did give us free cupcakes to take home to make up for the horrible food (although it turned out the cupcakes were also inedible and terrible).  \n\nWe hoped this was just an unusually busy night and not the norm, and because the fish fry is so good, we went back again tonight, hoping for a better experience.  We were wrong!  We went around 7 and waited 15 min or so for a table.  Once we were seated we placed our order right away with the waiter, since we already knew what we wanted.  An hour later, we were still waiting for our food.  All we ordered was the fish and waffle fries- so nothing complicated- and on such a busy night, you'd think they'd be making sure to keep batches of fish and fries going steadily into the fryer.  When we finally got our food, it was the tasty fish we'd remembered from before, but by that time, we were so tired and crabby from having to wait for so long, it wasn't quite so enjoyable.  After our meal, we had to wait quite a long time for the waiter to bring the check, and then he didn't come back to pick it up for a good 15 minutes.  We would still go back to Dexter's just for drinks, but I don't think we'll be going there to eat the food anymore.  Two terrible experiences with inexcusably long waits is enough to keep us from going back for dinner.  It's too bad because the fish is good, but not good enough to justify the SLOW service.\n\nEdit: Turns out the fish wasn't so good- ended up being up all night with food poisoning.

The clam chowder is phenomenal and so are the rest of their soups...obviously lovingly tended to and cooked from homemade stocks.  I could further pontificate, but no need...the execution in the kitchen is stellar.  \n\nNow, the beer list is exquisite in my opinion.  I love Madison, but many bars get so caught up on local-centric taps lists.  Consequently, more often than not, you walk in to see the taps jammed with Ale Ayslum, Lake Louie and Capital.  Not bad...but I'll be damned to say I could choke down another Hopalicious.  Dexters, on the other hand, opens their taps up to pretty much anything.  From Toppling Goliath (which I love, but you can't really get outside of Iowa and Wisco) to Belgian Flander's Reds, they kill it with their beer selection.  Also, I really respect that they let you know on the beer list what's on deck...this has kept me coming back many-a-times.  \n\nSo why not the 5-stars?

One thing to know beforehand is they do not take reservations and they pack the place on Friday nights. Expect to wait a while. This is a nice little neighborhood bar on the east side of Madison that has a huge following. They offer several different types of fish for the Friday fish fry. Fried or Baked Cod, Perch, or Walleye. I went with the fried cod which was absolutely delicious. I couldn't turn down the garlic chili fries or their home made chili. Needless to say I could have used a wheel chair for the way out! It was by far one of the better fish fry joints to go to in town and I will for sure be back. My only complaint with the place was that they don't take reservations and they won't do carry out during lent (due to an overwhelming amount of business) but it's good to see a business that does so much business they have to turn some away.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HTplzElel_F_U_qhWuDKdg"}

Then, they began to in process me before I got in the garage and started a light check. They were on it. After looking at the dipstick, the lead tech explained to me that I did not need an oil change and showed me the oil. It was still in good condition and since I was at 3k miles, it REALLY wasn't needed. My choice, but the advice was not to worry about  it. Their prompt communications, attention and honesty is a rare find in today's service world. I will be back for sure....and post this to yelp.\n\nJan 2013-Went back a couple months ago. Same thing. Repeated, honest service. Very nice!", "type": "review", "business_id": "izF6o43M1eWpivukmRQpRg"}

A few things were clearly older, but I got the impression they were gradually being improved. The bed was comfortable and there was an assortment of pillows. The shower was fine. The staff were very friendly, not only the folks at the front desk but also the cleaning crew. The Wifi was free and fast. There is a Starbuck's with limited hours in the hotel itself, but there is a full service one just a few hundred yards down the road. Also within easy walking distance is a large mall and some great places to eat (including Mexican and Japanese). The workout room includes two treadmills, an elliptical, a recumbent bike, some dumbbells, a bench, and a couple mats. The machines were older but of good quality. I stayed a Saturday night and there was a wedding at the hotel, but I had absolutely no issues with noise. Overall I was quite satisfied. I should also mention that they have a free shuttle van that will take you anywhere within a 3-mile radius. It leaves every hour or half hour.  I have never stayed in a hotel with that service before. So although the overall feel of the place may be three-star (yes, the big pool in the lobby reminds me of the Holiday Inns of the 80s), in my judgement the staff and the amenities put this in the four-star category.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Hh5lyZtOrS5LKk4YCgj8Kw"}

The appearance of the room is not pleasant (peeling wallpaper, poor paint, visible water damage in the room). The room appears to have last been updated prior to my birth (1980's). Upon arrival, a housekeeper was notified that the lamp in our room did not work. She replied that she would call downstairs to send someone up. Nobody came.  Four hours later, I found a maintenance worker myself who immediately came to the room and replaced the lamp. There is no fan in the bathroom, but that's not much of an issue because there isn't much steam since the water only gets lukewarm at best. On 4-21-14, at 3:44am I was unpleasantly shocked awake by a very loud alarm somewhere in the hall outside my room. I later found out that it was thought to be due to a dirty smoke detector. That increased my confidence in the overall cleanliness of the facility. On 4-22-14, I was appalled that a housekeeper walked into the room without even knocking. That was very frightening to hear a key card clicking in my door when I didn't have any guests!  There are six pieces of fruit put out on the front desk each morning. If you don't get one of those, you'll have to pay ten dollars for a mediocre breakfast bar. \n\nThis part deserves it's own paragraph. The smell of this facility is that of an angry, unbathed gladiator suffering the heat of a Roman sun mixed with the excretions of baby post-sweet potato. You've been warned. The air handling is so terrible, I truly cannot warn you enough. I am not able to hold my breath long enough to tolerate the stench. Particularly worrisome is that the stink is worst in a stairwell. If the dirty smoke detectors ever went of with warning of impending doom, that doom may be more so from the stairwell stink (remember not to play in elevators during a fire!) than the fire. \n\nThe pool is nice!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Hh5lyZtOrS5LKk4YCgj8Kw"}

This combined with being right by the highway and reasonable rates would warrant an easy 4 star review. \nSo - despite cheap beer, free popcorn and fast wifi - they lost the star for the abysmal 'gym'. One old treadmill and one elliptical in a tiny room. So, instead of getting my run in before I had to go to work in the morning, I logged my miles in the surrounding (very pleasant) neighborhood as the sun came up (there's a great hill and a few tiny parks that were fun to run through, large sidewalks and well marked streets). Fortunately, the runs were amazing, and the streets mostly well lit - but I would have been irate had I booked this room in the winter or if it was raining and I was stuck on the tredmill. \nSo If I'm back in Madison, I'll consider staying here again if the workout facilities are redone and expanded.

Far past the expiration date; 2. Poor quality; 3. Stale. Of the expired items I can recall, one was a package of tortillas, purchased in the last few days that expired 12/09/13! Almost a full month past expiration! A month ago, I bought hummus. It didn't look right when I opened it (mold), & of course, it had expired 2 weeks earlier. Fortunately, we didn't eat the hummus. Unfortunately, we discovered the tortillas had expired in the middle of dinner. \n\nThere've been a handful of instances where rolls/breads are stale, particularly from the bins by the registers. Rolls weren't just hard on the outside or a day past fresh-baked, we're talking inedible. It's incredibly disappointing too, when you're looking forward to good bread. \n\nThen there's the deli, where there's been a few issues. \n\nDeli issue #1: My wife bought sliced deli meat, a cut known for being fatty, but this one was overly so. It was slimy, chewy, tough, flavorless, & ultimately inedible. It was the first time I've returned meat. I'm a carnivore. I've had hackepeter, steak tartare, tripe, chitlins, sheep brain, sheep testicle... things most people won't eat. This particular deli meat however, was a few steps beyond. \n\nDeli issue #2: More an observation, which now prevents me from buying from the previously liked, pre-made deli salad section. One time at the deli counter, I saw a JSM worker \"clean\" the front of the pre-made salad case, from the inside, with a towel. Mind you, none of the salads were taken out of the case or covered for the cleaning process. So when this worker brought the towel back out of the case, I was aghast to see a dirty towel, with all sorts of crumbs, crumbles, food pieces & products, being carried haphazardly, over uncovered salads. I saw some bits fall from the towel, over the salads, as it was brought out of the case. \n\nDeli issue #3: A JSM worker cut slices of meat & cheese, kindly packaging them with care. However, he did so without gloves & without washing his hands. I was pretty much done with the JSM deli at this point. \n\nYou can have all the locally produced, environmentally friendly, organic, small batch, artisan &/or handmade, gluten-free, nonsense all you want. It does no good however, when it's stored in unclean, unsanitary conditions, &/or expired all together. If I were a \"freegan\" I'd say this place was a rip-off. Everyone knows you can get spoiled foods in dumpsters behind most grocery stores, for free. I'd also make exceptions for small \"mom & pop\" businesses, but I have standards & limits. JSM has surpassed both. It's unfortunate since we like the place, or rather, we want to like it, but there are just too many problems.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MLD-FXAHLbdiHOcyeoW-Fg"}

If you were to go in the middle of a weekday, you'll pay $1 for shoes and $2.50 for a game. I'll admit, my star rating is a little arbitrary in this case, as I am no bowling aficionado.

The breaded chicken pieces were out of this world-- soft, pillowy (yes pillowy) and simply addicting with each bite.

You gotta check it out. As for the kung pao & house special, they both could have had more umff and kick to it, but good nonetheless.\n\nThe only thing we worried about as we enjoyed our 3 dishes was the lack of patrons.

I have contemplated a dine and dash many times.  I counted the minutes one time, and it was 45 minutes from the time I finished eating to when the check came.

It was so tall, in fact, that it wasn't until I'd eaten enough of it that I noticed that the waiter (who was wearing a mohawk and kilt) had written, \"Das ist Deutsch\" in chocolate on the plate.  \n\nI've had questionable service twice: Once was when I reserved a pie for a dinner I was going to and they did not have it when I got there, but tried to placate me by selling me a larger, more expensive pie.  That was after I approached the counter and saw several staff members stare at me for 20 minutes before I was finally helped.  The other time was when I was there for coffee and dessert with friends, and we paid with a card.  The waiter told us, upon picking up the card, \"You know, if you can, you should really give me my tip in cash.  We don't see it on our paychecks for another 2 weeks otherwise.\"  Um...thanks for the advice on how we should tip you.  How about we don't tip you at all?\n\nBut those two experiences aside, nothing has been able to lessen my love of Monty's and all its glory.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA"}

On one hand, I want to say Monty's is an awesome place with great food. On the other hand I want to say Monty's is overrated. \n\nLet me explain. \n\nI love Monty's because of the options. If you are a vegetarian or vegan you aren't confined to the world of salads. There are many delicious and satisfying options. If you don't restrict your diet in any way, there are many great meaty and chalorically rich options for you too. Watching carbs? Get a sandwich in a wrap. Looking for a healthy lean meat option? Choose one of the several good chicken dishes. \n\nI personally steer towards the lean meat or veggie dishes and have never been disappointed. It's really hard to find a restaurant that caters to my needs as well as my boyfriend's nonrestrictive diet needs. This place does it well and at a pretty decent price. \n\nThough, I don't personally think Monty's is overrated, I feel that the point needs to be made. Whatever you order will be fresh and pretty tasty.

If you are looking for an extensive breakfast menu consisting of traditional American breakfast combos (i.e. - a dish that contains ALL of the following: pancakes, eggs, hash browns, 3 kinds of meat and toast), Denny's or Perkin's may be a better option for you. \n\nThey put their own spin on the more traditional dishes and have created an awesome list of in-house specialties. Whether you eat meat or not you MUST try The Meatless Meatloaf of the Gods. It's amazing. Like your beef? Definitely try the Blueplate Burger! Don't like beef so much but still want a burger?

Overall, though, it is far and away my favorite Food Fight place and a fairly reliable spot to get a good meal.\n\nMonty's food is better than hit-or-miss but not quite consistently good.  Most of the things I've eaten there, especially the breakfast foods, have been delicious (and huge), but I've had a couple of very sub-par meals (one was so bad I literally could not eat more than a couple of bites).  The things that I ate and disliked are now off the menu, so that does say something for their ability to identify what's working and what isn't.  What I can say is that the egg-based breakfast-y menu items are almost universally good.  The \"scrambled something-or-other\" never fails to disappoint, nor does the newer Blue Plate Omelet (the one with cheddar, avocado and bacon... good lord!).  And the breakfast burrito is especially good, even without chorizo (which is how I usually order it).  As for the breakfast side items, the potatoes are just okay; the biscuits are great.  Most importantly of all, the coffee is superb (even my mother thinks so and she drinks a hell of a lot more coffee than I do).  Unfortunately, I tend to shy away from the lunch and dinner items so I can't really speak to their quality.  The pies, though, are heaven.  And it's certainly worth noting that the menu pays special attention to including veg*n options.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty awesome.  Outdoor seating is spacious and comfy.  Indoors, the blue-topped tables are fun for making patterns with the wet bottom of your water glass.  Get a booth if you can; the tables are a bit cramped.  The waitstaff are generally friendly and attentive.\n\nThe upshot is that if you think you'll enjoy eating at a diner that's 70% greasy spoon and 30% hipster hot spot, and if you like breakfast foods and are a \"good orderer\" (you choose from menus wisely), Monty's is an excellent choice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA"}

I used to go with my parents as a kid, and now as an adult I've started to rediscover how much I loved their food.\n\nNestled in the eclectic Atwood Ave neighborhood, Monty's presents a 50's style diner with yummy lunch specials like meatloaf (very good meatloaf), sandwiches, and a wicked good brunch.  They also have ridiculously delicious chocolate shakes, so don't be afraid to splurge while you're there.  \n\nOne of the other great things about Monty's is the atmosphere; the area around it is filled with little mom and pop shops, the Barrymore theater, and relics of an older time.  Take a stroll around if it's a nice day and your bound to find something you like.  If not, I'm sure you probably enjoyed the food as all the dishes I've ever had were great and the portions were generous.\n\nThere are a few drawbacks though that held me back from giving a 5 star review.  First, there is usually a very long wait.  The place is popular, but I don't feel that the food and eastside location (I live far westside) always justifies the overall experience.  Secondly, the service is hit or miss.  I've had some waitresses who were prompt and polite, making me feel right at home, and others who were sarcastically rude to the point where people in my party almost had to say something.  Furthermore, the kitchen doesn't always look clean, as trays of biscuits have been left sitting out and flies have been a buzzing.\n\nSetting all those things aside though (which I know may be hard for some), the blue plate is a Madison delight that should not be missed.  The food is so good you'll be stuffed in a recliner when you get home pining for more.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA"}

It was weird.\n\nOur waiter failed to tell us the scrambler special and when we asked he told us it was artichoke, tomato and asiago. However, when it arrived the artichokes were not there. It was very disappointing. The breakfast potatoes were also a real let down. I love potatoes and they failed. However, the biscuit was delicious. \n\nWe also ordered pie.

I didn't mind, but others in my party did. Also, they only take Visa and Mastercard. \n\nOverall, the food was good, but the service was not.

They work hard to support local farmers, with dedicated local and organic specials featuring produce, meats and dairy from area growers. \n5. Their homemade biscuits are to DIE for.\n6. Try the pies.

I had to scarf down my food, only couple minutes after arriving at the table it was already getting cold.\n\nI ordered the Wisconsin Salmon Hash and it was pretty good. I was expecting a nice fillet of fish with my hash, but the salmon was pretty skimpy. Small pieces scattered throughout. It came with some pineapple, melon and a biscuit. The fruit was fresh and complimented the hash well. The biscuit wasn't bad but would have been much better if it had been served warm.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA"}

This delicious and clean diner serves up some tasty eats with a twist. It didn't take long for my buddy Corey D to share his love and thus I had to experience it for myself.\n\nIf you're not carrying a child, you must sample their drink menu. Looks super fantastic. Please have one for me. But beyond the cornucopia of boozy beverages lie various menus that will satisfy just about every craving. Sweet, savory, both...take your pick. \n\nDuring my visit, I sample the hash...but due to Corey's insight, I kindly asked if they could make my plate half sweet potato hash and half corned beef hash. Yes they can, and yes they did. The hash was nicely crisped and the corned beef perfectly salty. Portions were sizable without being gigantic, and honestly, I kind of appreciate that. No one needs to start their day with 6 pounds of corned beef hash. Yikes.\n\nThe sizes were just fine - I appreciate the substitution of fruit. Gotta add some healthy in your meal! My main gripe is for their biscuits. Mine was uber dry and crumbly. Bummer on the biscuit, but I'm sure I'll manage. \n\nNext time I make it up to Madison, I'd happily swing back into Monty's for another scrumptious breakfast.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA"}

I tried this place for the first time the other week when my grandparents were visiting me in Madison.  It was just wonderful!\n\nThe decor is adorable, the servers were friendly and prompt, and the food was fabulous.  I went with the Heathen Vegan Sandwich, which is piled high with mushrooms, tempeh, and avocado.  For my side, I chose the bean salad.  Both of these items were delicious.  The sandwich was HUGE.  I could not eat it like a regular sandwich, so I ate it in an open-faced sort of way with a fork.  A little messy, but totally worth it.  The mushrooms and tempeh were perfectly seasoned and tender and the avocado brought it all together with the toasted bread.\n\nI got a bit nervous because at the *very last second* my grandma changed her order to the exact same thing I got (she's not vegan) because she \"trusts me\".  I was pretty nervous, but she ended up loving it!  I was so pleased.  My one complaint might be that my bean salad had a bit too much dressing on it, but my grandma's did not share that problem and it wasn't difficult to just eat it with a fork instead of a spoon.\n\nMy grandpa ordered some sort of breakfast platter and was very pleased.  He basically always orders the same thing at diners - two poached eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast, so if he is impressed I feel that it is a good sign. He said the eggs were cooked perfectly.\n\nThey seem extremely accommodating for allergies and preferences as well, which is always a huge plus.\n\nOverall, I was very happy with my first visit to Monty's.   Not only because I loved my vegan options, but because you made my grandparents very happy too and that rocks in my book.  I will definitely be back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA"}

They are all different, yet are the same in one way.  They are good places to eat.\n\nMonty's is styled after a 50's diner - counter, chrome, lots of \"traditional\" diner foods, and a lot that you never got at a diner.  Service is fast, food is good, prices are reasonable (but not cheap) and wait staff is friendly.  Feels neighborhood friendly, although they bring in people from all over the area.  Plenty of good vegetarian options also.\n\nFood is interesting, with lots of things not found in your typical diner.   Coffee is from Just Coffee (that is a bonus feature people - if you like coffee, this is a great place) and many of the specials are made with organic foods.  Want a burger but don't eat meat?  Swap out the Walnut burger - which, as a meat eater, I can say is good.  Certainly better than their hamburger.  Speaking of which...\n\nWhat is up with that hamburger?  First off, it comes medium well done - no burger should ever be cooked to that.  Second, it is heavily, and funky seasoned.  As in, if I ordered it, it would go back.  A good burger needs salt and pepper.  They add a bunch of stuff.  However my niece who ordered it liked it, so we kept it.\n\nDeserts are very popular at Monty's, but that was our disappointment.  Cheesecake was rubbery and the carrot cake was dry - stale dry.  Really?  I am almost tempted to go to three stars just for that.\n\nOverall, I have to stick with four stars.  Great coffee, mostly really good, and interesting, food, fast, good service.  Without a doubt I will be back if in the area.  But I will skip desert.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA"}

My boyfriend did some yelping, and shortly we were on our way to Monty's. There is a private lot which is always nice when you're in a busy city. We did not sit outside because it was a little chilly but the patio looked pleasant and relaxing with beautiful flowers. When you go inside the ambience is a funky little 50's diner with amazing looking pies. Even though the restaurant was crowded, we were able to get a table fairly quickly. As I opened up the menu, I almost died but before that I even thought of moving to Madison right away! There are so many vegetarian, vegan, gluten free options that it is the majority of the menu, which is so rare to find at a breakfast diner. We both ordered the sweet potato hash and it was to die for! Just what we needed that day! I wish there was another one in Illinois.

Not a big deal but it essentially negated the discount / groupon we were using. \n\nSecond, almost everything was mislabeled! Cube steak was hamburger patties. Chicken breasts were chicken tenders. Beef hamburgers were bratwurst patties. Pork cutlets were sausage patties....etc. Again, not a huge deal but annoying when you plan ahead, thaw an item for meal and end up having to improvise in the end anyway (hamburger stir fry isn't bad, neither is a bratwurst cheeseburger).\n\nFinally, I am not sure it was an outstanding value. We ended up with about 70 hot dogs, assorted bratwurst and assorted bratwurst patties which are quite inexpensive. Of the remaining items, portions were quite small and anything expensive was bulked up by wrapping it in bacon.

The farm house where the guests stay is tastefully decorated. There is a nice living area and a library area where you can lounge about. There is also a mini kitchen you can use, if needed, with snacks. Our room was a very good size and it was neat and clean. We had a tv and dvd player with movies to choose from. I also noticed how nice and quite it was. 4 of the 5 rooms were filled while we were there and yet it was always very quiet in our room. The breakfast was wonderful! The owners are very good cooks and served us 2-3 courses for breakfast. Some of the food we ate, like the eggs and some fruits were straight from the farm. Free WiFi was another convenient bonus.

The place is T-I-N-Y tiny, but that's not a bad thing.  There are a handful of tables around the outside of the bar, and about 25-30 seats at the actual bar itself.  A low ceiling lends to the really smallish feel of the place.\n\nGreat jukebox, great service, good value.  We really enjoyed hanging out at the Villa Tap.  \n\nDrinks: we tried the whiskey old fashioned sour.  Lost points for not being muddled and for not using Squirt.  It was decent, regardless, and a great value; three old fashioneds came in at under $10.\n\nFood-wise - mixed results.  The appetizers (onion rings and cheese curds) were excellent.  Some of the best we've ever had, even if the curds were \"out of the box\" curds.  They were cooked perfectly, didn't show any signs of grease, and were absolutely wonderful.\n\nThe fish - we had deep fried cod all around - left much to be desired.  It was cooked better than any other fish we've ever had - it was so perfectly prepared... the batter was light and crispy; it was served piping hot; no signs of grease - it had all of the makings of a great fish fry.\n\nBut it was too fishy tasting; not in a good way, but in a bad way.  Cod shouldn't have a strong fish flavor.  Save that for bad Ocean Perch or Smelt... and that's what this cod tasted like.  :-(  So, despite being prepared to perfection, it failed to deliver on taste.\n\nThe fries were perfect, which is such a shame.  The Villa knows how to fry a mean dish - just wish the fish wasn't so \"off\" tasting.  We'll give them another shot, though.  I'm sure the burgers and other offerings are going to be good - The Villa was spot-on with everything else, so the fish may have been a fluke.\n\nVilla Tap = No Win/No Fail - it's a tie\n\nService = 4 stars (fast, prompt, spot-on)\nFood = 2.5 stars (fish = fail; all others = win)\nValue = 4 stars ($40 for 3 people with appetizers and fish)\nMisc = 4 stars (atmosphere, homey feel)\n\nDefinitely a great little bar; we'll give the fish another shot at some point and we'll certainly try the rest of the menu items!", "type": "review", "business_id": "J2AiPQnKWBxBwc4MMkbH8w"}

I am giving this place 5 stars because it is wonderful for a very simple meal, with excellent service. \n\n We had a little trouble finding the door (the entrance is in the back facing away from Packers Ave.) but once we walked in and sat at one of their wobbly tables, we were instantly greeted by our friendly server.  Though the bar was busy, we got our drinks immediately, along with a basket with two basic white bread rolls and coleslaw.  All very standard issue.  \n\nThe fish was another story. Whoa.  I got the Canadian perch and my boyfriend got the Canadian walleye.  The large single piece of walleye was lightly breaded and fried perfectly.  It was buttery, non-fishy, and totally delicious.  The baked potato that came with it was pretty standard, but good.  The perch was battered differently in a thicker, more crunchy coating.  The little strips were just AMAZING.  I got a pile of 7 or 8 strips that I honestly couldn't stop eating.  The fries were done to perfection as well.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I are somewhat light eaters in general, but we cleared out all of that fried goodness in one sitting.  On the way out the cooks from the back yelled good bye, the bartender wished us a good night, and someone standing by the door smiled and asked us to come back soon.  I can't say enough about how friendly everyone here is.  It looks like a burned out biker bar, but their simple menu is done right.  I never thought I would like a place so much that doesn't have salad on their menu, but I anticipate we will be back many many more times.", "type": "review", "business_id": "J2AiPQnKWBxBwc4MMkbH8w"}

For every positive interaction I have, I have two negatives ones.  My husband and I just bought a house, so you can imagine how much time we spend here.  I prefer Home Depot but the prices are so much lower at Menard's.\n\nIn the matter of two weeks, all of this happened:\n\n1. I bought a can of paint for our guest room.  I wanted the best paint, with the primer, all the bells and whistles.  I was covering purple.  I needed it.  The salesperson said I could pick from any four.  Yet, he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same brand.\n\n2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.  So we go back to Menard's.  We have shopped at several area Menard's, because we are about convenience.  The lady at the counter was SO rude.  We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.  It had a Menard's sticker which this location does not use (but other locations still use).  \n\nEVERY time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here.  We then had to repeat AGAIN, that we do not just shop at this location.  We shop outside the city sometimes.  We pick things up on our way home.  \n\nAnother rep interceded and offered to return it for us.  She was SO nice.  I wish I remembered all of their names.  But she needed a person from paint to approve it.\n\nBefore looking at the paint, a rep spoke to this RUDE customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back.  It must be our fault and that is that.  Then they said they could not take and dispose of it.  Nice huh?  No one asked us anything.  The paint was BRAND new!  \n\n3. The same day we went to return the paint, we wanted to look at screen doors.  There was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone.  He was SO short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions.  It was ridiculous.  \n\nSo the prices keep us going back but the rest?  Awful/Hellish.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IoPdC59QwkWYm31xPkwcPw"}

Lately, I've only been coming here when I absolutely must; I much prefer going to my local hardware store - their selection for anything that's not a big-ticket item is better, as is the service and overall experience. \n\n- There are signs posted in several places that claim, \"No waiting for savings! If there are more than 2 customers waiting to check-out, we'll open additional check-out lanes!\" -- I have yet to see this happen. A most recent visit left us waiting in line for nearly 10 minutes before checking out.\n\n- The indoor/outdoor lumberyard is a source of frustration. I would venture a guess that one of the more commonly sought items from a hardware store like Menards is the basic 2x4 (or similar dimensional piece of lumber). Any idea where they're located? We wandered the indoor lumberyard for a good 5 minutes before realizing that the 2x4s are located in the faaaaaaaaaar back corner from the main entrance. You have to walk by scores of 1-by-whatevers, fence posts, fence slats, decorative posts, synthetic decking, lattice, and other rarely used items before you get to the 2-by-whatevers. Do you need pressure treated wood? That's outside, somewhere. Do you need cedar? That's on the opposite end of the indoor yard. Do you need plywood? It's at the front of the lumberyard. Do you need insulation? It's in the middle of the lumberyard... catch the problem? There's zero organization/logic...\n\n- The outdoor lumberyard. I hate (as do my contractor friends) checking in and out with the lumberyard guard. Put it all inside like every other store does and call it good.\n\n- Limited supply of plumbing items. I recently needed a Sharkbite connector for a plumbing project I was doing with PEX. Menards didn't have the fittings, but my tiny little local Ace Hardware did. A few days ago, I needed a John Guest fitting, which Menards didn't have, but my local Ace Hardware did. \n\n+ Holiday sales are usually a good deal, especially for large ticket items like ceiling fans and whatnot.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IoPdC59QwkWYm31xPkwcPw"}

Either way, that Parthenon in Madison is crap, people rave about it, what a joke, they have no clue what good gyros is, take a road trip and go eat at Hubs in Chicago, then you will know finally what great gyros is. In the meantime, if you are stuck in Madison, this is by far the best you will find, don't waste your money and calories elsewhere.\n\nFalafel is good, has it's own unique recipe, works for me.\n\nTan Tan Chicken is very good too, highly spiced, which I like, although not spicy as far as heat is concerned. Comes with an awesome garlic dip, which I've only found in Los Angeles at Zankou Chicken, which by the way is the most incredible middle-eastern chicken ever. They even made a \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" episode about it in 2011. If you get out to LA ever, you must go to Zankou and get the Chicken Tarna with the garlic dip, the hummus is also the best ever. Almost enough to make me want to move back to LA. In fact...\n\nAnyway, People's Bakery is truly a gem in Madison, amongst all the questionable eateries, which some say are great, others say bad, this one is clearly a huge winner. And it is a real Mom & Pop, literally they made all the food for me, super friendly, down to Earth, real people who deserve to have your business. Go there now!\n\nP.S.

Aggressive herbal flavors perfectly matched with a spike of lemony acidity.  My wife LOVED her falafel sandwich...which is really saying something, as she's somewhat of connoisseur.  The hummus was really good, and the spike of sumac was a nice touch, although it was tad bit to lemony for me.  \n\nNonetheless, this is an AWESOME Madtown ethnic eats spot...and oh yeah...how can  completely dismiss the incredible homemade donut selection?

The red lentil soup made with sprouted lentils came in a bowl - a real bowl, not a cup-sized bowl.

By itself, the mousaka would last me two additional meals. We couldn't resist the Boston creme donut, which turned out to be the best I've had in Madison, and a gigantic cinnamon roll fritter. Plus the two coffees, the total came out to be $25 (!!) and some change. \n\nThe service is a relaxed pace, but the owners were charming and seemed to enjoy us enjoying their food.

After fellow Yelper Tawnie R boldly declared the People's Bakery as the worthy successor to Dimitri's, I knew a trip to the People's Bakery was in the cards for me.\n\nIf you are looking for elegant digs, this place is not for you.  It's a kitschy, little greasy spoon nestled into a strip mall at the corner of East Wash and East Johnson.  There's not a lot of seating and if someone is on the phone, you're going to be privy to their conversation.  In my case, I got a comprehensive update on a bedbug infestation of a family member that the owner's wife was describing in painstaking detail.  And while the chairs and tables are mismatched and the floor tiles are coming loose in places, the eating surfaces were all impeccably clean and the pictures on the wall gave the joint a homey feel.  And the husband and wife team that run the place have a great rapport with the regular customers getting their lunch fix. \n\nI ordered the $5.50 gyros and fries and grabbed a seat.  About ten minutes later, a massive foil wrapped gyros was delivered to my table.  I swear that an entire herd of sheep were sacrificed for this meal.  In terms of quantity, the People's Bakery delivered big time.  \n\nOn the quality side, things were a little less clear cut. First the negatives:\n* The next time I visit, I'm going to ask to have the pita spend a little time on the grill.  This dish deserves better than a cold, doughy pita.\n* More tzatziki sauce please!!!  When you give me a metric ton of lamb meat, I need more than a tablespoon of sauce to balance out the dish.\n* The same can be said of the tomatoes.  I need more than two very thinly cut slices.\n\nNow the positives:\n* The meat was served piping hot, moist and well seasoned.  It was clear this meat wasn't sitting under a heat lamp awaiting the lunch time crush.  The only thing I would have changed is to have a little char on some of the pieces to provide more textural contrast.\n* The onions served with the dish were pure awesomeness.  I'll be honest, I usually pick most of the onions off my gyros because they can overpower the other ingredients with their sulfuric pungency.  With a medium dice, these onions were fresh and sweet and complemented each bite.\n* I l-o-v-e-d the fries that accompanied the meal.  Salty and crunchy on the outside and hot and moist on the outside.   Yummmmmm.\n\nSo, does the People's Bakery unseat Trader Gus as my King of Madison Gyros.  I say it's too close to call right now.  What I do know is that I plan to return to the People's Bakery to conduct more extensive research.  And if you find yourself on the east side with an empty stomach and a light wallet, People's Bakery is an option worth considering.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ryq600aoE3h8_qRQGIed9A"}

I went in to get a manicure and pedicure both with shellac polish. I had called to set up an appointment beforehand for my friend and I and I asked how much it would be for the shellac on both my hands and feet. The woman I talked to said $60. That's what I usually pay for the other place I go to but wanted to try this place out cause people said they did a good job. \nThe day of our appointment we showed up and they started our hands first...they seated us away from each other when they knew we had come in together. So that bothered me right off the bat. I had gotten a design on one nail on each hand and the girl did a great job with the design and painting my nails. \nThen it was time for my pedicure, once again they sat my friend and I away from each other. We barely got a chance to talk because they sat people in between us too. The woman that gave me my pedicure did a great job painting my nails but a horrible job with everything else. The main reason I get pedicures is not for them to paint my nails (I can do that myself) I'm paying for them to scrub my feet, massage and whatever else to make my feet smooth. The woman scrubbed my feet for 5 minutes and that was it.  I was very disappointed. Especially when I saw that everyone else there had a lot more done then me. \nWhen I went up to pay the woman said the total was $80!! I told her I was told $60 then the woman said that I has gotten a design... My friends total came to $60 and she had gotten shellac on her hands but regular polish on her toes....so I paid $20 more for a small design and a bad pedicure. \nLater in the day my feet were already dry so it was like I never got a pedicure. I left that salon very disappointed and will never go back again. Or recommend it to anyone.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sUxPe5A2NvEHs12UokMyBQ"}

After that he spent at least 15 minutes trying to clean up the mess by using tons of cotton and acetone. My nails were left incredibly sloppy: polish on the nails was a mess, polish all over my toes, cotton stuck everywhere. Worse, the acetone caused more polish to run onto my toes. I had to go straight to a wedding afterwards, but I removed the polish when I got home that night. What's worse? The shaping of my nails was bizarre. Three of my toe nails were shaped like smiley faces, clipped all the way to my toe in the center of the nail and high on the edges.

As a result, they focus on value and entertainment. \n\nInexpensive tickets, good and reasonable food/beverages are a Godsend. I just came from Milwaukee -- three tickets with views that do not require binoculars will run you over $100. A crap beer (Miller brands) in a plastic bottle runs another $6.50.

Their wait staff (yes, wait staff) is friendly and efficient with your orders, so you can enjoy the show. \n\nFour mascots are always running around the stadium rally-mongering and adding to the enjoyment. In between innings, the festivities including a t-shirt toss, bat spin, children and mascot races and more. The PA announcer consistently appeals to the good-natured (but peculiar) kitsch that fills a family-oriented outing (refers to foul balls as wieners or frankfurters for no particular reason).

When I was a kid I remember coming to many a Muskies game with my parents, but the crowds were always thin and no one was surprised when the Muskies and the subsequent teams folded.  Now Warner Park is a family destination as well as a popular party location.  For the last several years my company has held our summer outing here, tailgating in the parking lot before catching the game.  There always seems to be a huge crowd on the weekends.  \n\nThe Mallards organization provides an atmosphere that was missing when I was a kid.  Personally I love the game of baseball, with all of the intricacies of the pacing being a big part of the charm.  However, I realize that I'm in the minority here, because most of my friends find it kind of boring.  But the Mallards have really energized the park with the give-aways, the mascots, and all the other sideshows to the game.  My opinion is that if you want to see baseball played in all of it's old fashioned glory, go to Wrigley.  \n\nThe Duck Blind is the place to be for most of the adults that didn't bring children to the game.  For $25-35 it is all you can eat and drink in a sectioned-off area in the right field corner.  The food is pretty decent but the real attraction is the beer.  Led by local brewpub Great Dane's signature Mallards Ale, there is an excellent selection of beer.  This is undoubtedly why a lot of people attend, but it leads to a very festive atmosphere that is always a good time.  The only people not enjoying the Duck Blind are usually the opposing team's relief pitchers, since their bullpen is in the right field corner as well.  You can also win free tickets to the Duck Blind from US Cellular on the day of the game.  \n\nOutside of the Duck Blind, the park is very kid-friendly, with various mascots running around and all sorts of things to keep the kids occupied.  The main mascot rides a zipline down from the party deck in the Duck Blind to home plate to start off the game and set the tone.  It's always about having a good time.  The various promotions include \"B-List Celebrity Fridays,\" various throwback nights and bands playing live music.  The concessions range from the traditional hot dogs, peanut and cotton candy to the truly excellent jambalaya.  The prices are quite reasonable and the people working are always friendly and appear to be having as much of a good time as the fans.

Getting there early also sets your mind at ease about getting your money's worth.  Let's face it, $33 on a weekend is a bit stiff.  If you don't get there early, you have to pound it, and then you run out of room, and the rest of the night will be shot.  Don't do that.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4N7dN61pyPfcxmKgXWQPfw"}

I think it includes a reserved picnic table and a better view of the game; however, if you're willing to come to the regular Duck Blind section soon after the gates open (90 minutes before the game), you can call dibs on a table in the cheaper section. \n\nOverall, it was a great value for 4 1/2 hours of food, beverage and entertainment.

Ohhhhhh! \nSeriously though, I can't remember the last time I had so much fun at a ballpark. Sure the space itself leaves little to be desired. It's small. Seating is uncomfortable, and depending on where you're at the sun can be beating down on you for quite a while.

Hey look at that! It's like an ADD wet dream. You're never bored. You can't be! The activities and inning breaks definitely cater towards kids, but I found myself laughing, cheering, screaming wiener at the top of my lungs. Food in my opinion is only so, so. I like that there are local options but they're not great. They can't be... it's a ballpark and they're using prep kitchens. I will say the beer options are nothing short of amazing. I also dig that players typically stick around after the game and sign stuff for the little ones. It doesn't get more local than a Mallards game, except on July 4th of this year at the Hometown Classic. What's a Hometown Classic you ask?

(Did you know there are no nails in the entire structure? I think that is so amazing!) \n\nThe Bolz Conservatory is also open year round. It includes tropical plants as well as many species of smaller creatures be them mammal, bird, or butterfly. While the Gardens in Chicago or Domes in Milwaukee might run you a pretty penny, the Conservatory costs only $2. The gigantic koi, the exotic trees, and not even to mention being the cheapest sauna in Wisconsin! This place is so worth it! I adore it and still pickup the 'kids-only' scavenger hunt.\n\nEverything about this place is delightful. Also, I have navigated this place, with the exception of the rock garden, with a wheelchair. So for those concerned about others who cannot walk far or without assistance, there are many benches and areas for a rest! Did I mention that it is free?

I've really only been to two official botanic gardens (mostly CBG) however I'm glad Olbrich was another to add to my list. \n\nIt was absolutely pouring down rain when we arrived, which was actually ok because the doors hadn't opened yet, and it also gave us an opportunity to have the gardens to ourselves once we were let in. We checked in with the ladies at the front desk and they happily pointed us to the garden areas and told us about the park; they also lent us an umbrella which was nice customer service. \nWe had a plan to do a loop and visit the famous Thai garden (awesome) and our idea paid off greatly. With the rain ever-present we had our own rainforest jungle to enjoy to ourselves, which made for a very peaceful experience. We passed back around to the rose garden and detoured around the flooded pathways, so I'm not entirely sure which gardens we passed through.\n\nAfter getting soaked (I'm glad I had my waterproof kayaking shoes in the car) we walked through the indoor garden, which was free because I had my membership card for the CBG, otherwise it would have been $2. Even if I had to pay I would have been satisfied, it was pretty cool. They had a variety of trees, fish, painted pheasants, a waterfall, and other hidden gems I wont spoil. \n\nAlthough we didn't make a purchase, their gift shop area was pretty nice for its size. If we had more time and nicer weather, I wouldn't hesitate to make this garden a destination for a bit. It's so close to Chicago so I can't see why that would be a difficult task to accomplish. \nI'll be back for sure; but next time I'll bring the sunshine.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Q3GGB4ZMajP-Qmtdr1cVZw"}

When we came in, she followed us and goes \"10 minutes left\". Um again, what?!  I would assume she's walked the grounds before, and it takes a while to get around, especially in heels.  We ended up going 10 minutes over.. Oops. And my photographer stayed to take pics with my ring. Apparently the woman tracked her down and said she needed to leave. I was so excited to take my engagement pics there, considering they will be the only ones I take, and this lady ruined it. I've never been treated so terribly. Especially in a public place like that.

I wonder if people go to bed early around this neighborhood or if this place just isn't that popular.\n\nCoconut soup was weird .  A mix of hot coconut milk that's been watered down and then laden with sweetened baking coconut from a bag.  This was definitely not fresh coconut in any way and I found this soup to be disapointing.   \n\nLamb Saag was about as much lamb as you might expect for a dish costing 12.95. It's uniform liquidey sludge was a little too reminiscent of diarrhea for me and I lost a little of my appetite, though the lamb was tender and cooked well.  The overall dish was very very salty with no special taste.  Just a little spicy, a little Indian, and a little lamb.  They are probably using curry paste from a jar, or there is just not a very imaginative cook in the kitchen because the whole dish was lacking in flavor (besides salt).  A whole cardamom pod was left hidden in the diarrhea sludge, which led to an unpleasant burst of cardamom in one bite.\n\nRice had clearly been sitting around for awhile and was very dry throughout with crunchy bits and very chewy bits.  I just don't see how this is acceptable to serve someone in a restaurant.  Rice is one of the cheapest ingredients out there.  If the rice has been sitting for too long, throw it out and make more.  \n\nI tried the saag with the rice and the oily mess of lamb Saag rehydrated the rice somewhat, and the rice's absorption of the Saag took away some of its saltiness.\n\nThree sauces or chutneys that came with the papadom were not very good at all. \n\nHad to ask to have my water glass filled every single time I finished it.

Everything from tandoori chicken to palak aloo. Every dish was so flavorful and authentic. Having spent two years overseas where I associated with several Indians, I know they would have been suitably impressed. The waiter brought naan to the table and was there when our water glasses emptied. He didn't hover but he was attentive.\n\nMy lunch partner and I got a kick out of the sign that politely let buffet eaters know we were welcome to the food but would be charged for waste. It should go without saying, but I have been to several all-you-can-eat buffets and have witnessed first hand the amount of leftover food that has to be thrown away because people take too much. Personally I think part of the blame should be placed on the cooks/managers for not putting out a better product, but certainly the customer is largely to blame. Hence, a sign that clearly articulates the Maharaja's expectation of its customers is a good thing. Let's face it, if the food was bad, the customer would be screaming...\n\nBottom line, Eat here if you love Indian food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jqo3Ljexof9sA8PhSTwEjA"}

The service took a long time, even though there were only 5 tables with customers and six wait staff.  The server did not understand English well enough to properly place the order, so there was extra wine for one person.  Also, the glassware and flatware were spotted, with some that needed to be sent back.\n\nThe service had really changed for the worse.

It had only been approximately 6 weeks. Apparently, this location has been sold.  The old owners still own the location on Odana Rd (same name), but not this one.

When living in Madison years ago, we used to hit all the great fish fries on the lakes around town. And while spending 10 years in Hayward, we used to live for Fridays at Lost Land Lake Lodge and later The Waterfront. Living in Utah for over 20 years, my opportunities are few and far between. So I was excited to have a free Friday in Madison to try the very best. Reading online reviews, going off my past knowledge and talking to friends, I made the tough call between the Avenue Bar (one of my favorite lunch spots) and the Esquire Club. We chose the Esquire.\n\nI hadn't been in the club in probably 30-35 years. Overall, it was a good experience. But it wasn't close to the level to which I'm accustomed to in Hayward on our three or four trips out there a year. We had a great time and I highly recommend it, but we would make another choice next time.\n\nThe bar at Kavanaugh's Esquire Club is great - a full horseshoe with plenty of seating. We arrived around 5:30 p.m. on a Friday in Lent. It was packed already, as was every spot in the parking lot. We put our name in and were told it would be 20 minutes for our party of two. We were seated in just ten.\n\nOne of the challenges with the Esquire is it just doesn't have a lot of natural atmosphere. The main room with the bar is fabulous. But the other dining rooms are really plain with not a single thing on the wall. The table settings are nice. And outside, it's a totally blah building. Out the back door to the parking lot was an attractive collection of a few hundred cigarette butts sitting on the sidewalk and snowbank.\n\nThe tables are pre-set with great, fresh rye bread and fabulous cole slaw. And we had quick attention from our waitress. The host gave us menus - actually three stapled, photocopied sheets - pretty tacky (I noticed others did get regular menus). It's a full supper club menu with multiple choices for fish fry. We opted for the $9.95 all-you-can-eat ocean perch. What was notable to me as that the current Web page for Esquire lists the price at $8.95. Not good. Cod was also available at a slightly higher price.\n\nThe bread and slaw kept us entertained and both were world class. A heaping plate of fish and crinkle fries arrived in good time (beating the Coke our grandson ordered 15 minutes earlier). We had to ask for lemons.\n\nThe fish was very good - I love perch. But as good as it was, it simply wasn't at the presentation and taste level of what we traditionally get at The Waterfront in Hayward, for example. It was a simple cornbread-type breading that was good, but somewhat uninteresting - not the flamboyant texture of the beer battered fish we have grown to expect.\n\nNonetheless, we polished off the fish, got a few more fries and a chocolate mousse desert. The bill for two with a few beers and desert was just under $40.\n\nLater that night, we also hit the Beachhouse in McFarland, another popular local spot. My wife had dinner there with a friend. This is an awesome place with a ton of atmosphere and great fish.\n\nEsquire Club Summary (five point scale)\nExterior: 2 - Pretty plain building; cigarette butts not pretty\nInterior atmosphere: 3 - Main bar room is great\nFood: 4 - Good was great, not overally thrilled with fish batter\nService: 3 - Generally good, but shouldn't have to wait for main course to get a Coke\nValue: 5 - $9.95 for an all-you-can-eat fish fry at this level is outstanding", "type": "review", "business_id": "68JsiWNLKs8NDCrBCxIWMA"}

We were told it would be about 20 minutes to seat our small group, and that was just fine. The bar was cozy, the beers fresh, and the service attentive, friendly, and helpful.\n\nSoon enough, our name was called and we were seated in one of the \"auxillary\" dining areas. Clearly an add-on, not a single decoration, but definitely welcomed; the place was packed and we were seated quickly, so it's all good by me.\n\nOur waitress took our orders and brought us a round of Whiskey Old Fashioned Sours. We gnoshed on the deliciously fresh rye bread, which was unlike any other rye I've had. It featured a very mild rye flavor and a very light texture. It was delicious.\n\nFish arrived within minutes: fried ocean perch and battered cod, one order of fries, and two orders of cheesy hashbrowns (cost an extra $2 per).\n\nThe fried ocean perch is all you can eat, and it's fresh, lightly breaded, flavorful, grease-free, and easily some of the best fish I've had at a fish fry. I scarfed down three heaping plates, and I do mean \"heaping.\" They're not skimpy with the refills.\n\nBattered cod was equally good, but it wasn't all you can eat. Three large, beautifully brown, battered and flaky filets are what you get.\n\nFries were outstanding as well; crinkle cut, fresh, hot, crispy. Yum. Hashbrowns were cooked perfectly but the slab of Velveeta that was slapped on top to make them \"cheesy\" was disappointing.\n\nService was the best yet. No complaints. Three fish dinners with coffees and a couple of rounds of drinks was $70 + tip... A bit pricey by my book.\n\nEsquire Club = WIN.\n\nFood= 4.75 stars\nOld Fashioneds= 3.5 stars\nService = 5 stars\nValue = 3 stars\nMisc = 4 stars (speedy seating and service; lost points for bland interior and no potato pancake option)", "type": "review", "business_id": "68JsiWNLKs8NDCrBCxIWMA"}

Only downer was the downstairs dining area--kinda felt like a church bingo hall.\n\nSoft, tender & delicious bread, oddly sweet coleslaw.

Un(der)seasoned but not greasy, breading a little thicker than desired. Crinkle-cut fries were great but also needed salt. Tartar sauce was a little too heavy on the mayo.

They usually get pretty busy (usually a good sign), but that night we didn't have to wait long for a table. I ordered the Icelandic Cod and It was terrible. As this was a few months ago, my brain is clouded on which exact fish (cod or perch) the comments were made about, but as I recall: The waitress claimed that the cod isn't \"fresh\" and she knew I didn't like it, so she offered to get me some perch, which was fresh. That wasn't much better. One (either the cod or the perch) of them tasted, looked like and smelled like a \"fish stick.\" It literally looked like a kiddie meal. All in all, I will never return for a fish fry there. The waitress was very attentive and tried to make me happy, but it was not her fault, she did everything she could to please me.

The sad thing is that we \"tried\" to go to Red Lobster first, but were repelled by the large crowd of waiting people.  No, I don't want to stand around like cattle waiting for my pager to buzz so I can be ushered to a cramped seat, fed, branded, and ushered out again stampede style.  The mighty gods of chain restaurants everywhere are wagging their fingers at me right now saying, \"what do you expect lady?\"  I know, I know.  \n\nSo we went to Olive Garden down the street.  No wait there.  Our waitress was very young, I'll refer to her as \"Sparky\".  My dining companion had a sudden need to try some wine, so he asked Sparky what would pair well with the lasagna.  She didn't come across confident as she pointed to the list of wines on the menu that mister dining companion was holding.  She finally chose one and said that it would go well with the \"meaty\" dish.  I'm not sure what either one of us was expecting because after all this is Olive Garden and we have almost zero knowledge of wines.  So de-classA!!  \n\nAfter Sparky left our table, dining companion says that he expects the chosen wine to be the suck because Sparky doesn't look like she's even old enough to drink, let alone have knowledge of the fine wines.  But you know, none of this really matters when you consider the fact that compared to her we are old as dirt, and still don't know shit about wine.\n\nI had the eggplant Parmesan with Alfredo sauce.  It usually comes with marinara, but if I'm going to have a heart attack it had better well be because of something I enjoyed eating, not something I felt like I had to eat in the name of my health!  Hell no!  \n\nDining companion had his red wine something or other, and he was right it sucked.  He described it as tasting like, \"the barrel it came out of\".  \n\nAfter the main course I had the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake.  I made sure to look in a direction where no one could see my face before I crossed my eyes from sheer delight.  I am a pumpkin lovin' nerd by nature, and this cheesecake was gooood.\n\nSo this chain experience wasn't too bad.  The only thing that sucked was no refill on the bread sticks.  If I'm going to go slummin' at the chain restaurants, I expect the constant refills man.  Especially on those items they advertise as \"bottomless\" and/or \"never-ending\".   Finally, Sparky took a long time to bring by the check, and this goes against the code of chain fine dining, wham, bam, thank you mam.

I bet It's great\", but never got around to visiting. So, when I found out they had opened back up with a new owner, a food menu, and a new look I decided I had better get over there. \n\nSeriously, folks - what a great little place. \n\nAfter a bit of a rough start where-in I ordered a beer that I couldn't even look at because it was so awful  (the Dogfish Head T'weason Ale - what a disaster of a beer. They were super cool and replaced it with their house old-fashioned, which was one of the best takes on the cocktail I have ever had) the meal went really smooth - especially considering how crazy busy it was.\n\nBetween the three of us we ordered 2 burgers, cheese curds, and the fish fry special. The burger was delicious, moist, and cooked extremely well. The coleslaw was tasty, but had way too much vinegar. The fries were crispy and free of excess oil which was nice. Apparently the fish was delicious as well. Finally - the curds. Oh man, the curds! They were seriously (tip) top-notch. Lightly breaded, crispy, and gooey with some nice tasting ranch on the side. These are the closest to perfection I have ever had. Hopefully it wasn't a fluke!\n\nBeyond the food and drink, it really was a nice space. The lighting was great, the decorations were were fun, and it just felt like a cozy place that I would love to hang out at on a Wednesday night to grab a burger and a beer.\n\nI feel like all I have done lately is write about how awesome the spots I go to are, but hopefully that says more about how great Madison is than it does about my (potentially) overly-optimistic ratings.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JJFoeKZXgi2_LeECDMkkoQ"}

The staff members were all very nice and did a great job. The bitchy people  next to us were treated a lot nicer than they deserved.

My husband, a beer aficionado, loved the beer list, which includes 2 nitro taps.\n\nWe were there again last night with friends for the fish fry. When I read the menu, I was intrigued by the Rooster sandwich, which is essentially a BLT + fried egg. I'm so glad I tried this instead of the fish because it was really good. It's such a large sandwich, though, it is probably better to split with a friend. I can't believe I'm going to write this, but there may have been TOO much bacon (although I managed to eat the entire thing)! If you love bacon, this is the sandwich for you!\n\nMy husband had the fish, which was a nice piece of walleye and perfectly fried. He doesn't normally like cole slaw but specifically noted how much he liked the slaw.

I definitely liked the ambiance of this space a lot. A charming neighborhood bar with horizontal narrow wood paneling, lower lighting, tiled floor, tin ceiling, and a very pretty border/trim around the ceiling. Being a small-ish space with lower ceilings and hard floors, it does get a bit noisy when the place fills up so best to beat the rush if you're sensitive to that sort of thing. Also, it's another CASH ONLY spot so be sure to stock up or else they have an ATM on site.\n\nMy co-workers and I headed here for drinks one Friday. The place seemed to have a \"must order food\" policy in order to be seated at the tables so 15 of us frustratingly spent a bit of time crowded at the entrance, downing beers, trying to decide if we should move on. Fortunately, I think the staff finally figured out that two beers basically equals the cost of a sandwich (so what's the difference) and we got a nice row of tables.  Whew!  The place was definitely running a wait by 6:30pm so, again, head out early/late!\n\nThe Mister and I headed here at 6pm on a Saturday and were able to snag the last open table in the place. The beer list is good and reasonably priced ($4).  The menu offers burgers, apps, and sandwiches and sports several vegetarian options. Mr. had the special (Walleye sandwich) which he enjoyed while I had the Seitan Philly ($8.95), also tasty. We started with the cheese curds ($5.95) which were yummy. I'd previously had the kettle chips/dip, which were just that, chips/dip, nothing fancy and the fried pickles which weren't my favorite... \n\nAll in all I really liked the ambiance (but I'd go early so I can hear better) and appreciate the reasonably priced & yummy options for both vegetarians and carnivores.  I hope they are able to work out the kinks along the way (i.e., must order food to get a seat policy) but overall think this is a very nice addition to the neighborhood.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JJFoeKZXgi2_LeECDMkkoQ"}

I mean, at dinnertime on Friday night there were families eating here with lots of kids.  That's kind of weird to me.  First, I wouldn't think it would be appropriate to take young kids to a bar.  Second, I don't really want to be around kids when I go to a bar.  But everyone seemed to be perfectly happy with it, so that makes me the odd man out.  \n\nWe had burgers, and they were pretty good.  The menu had all the usual pub grub, and they also make pizzas.  Many people were eating them, but we didn't try it, so, shrug.  We also had cheese curds.  They were, well, cheese curds... (I'm sorry, I'm not a huge fan, so I can't tell the quality).  \n\nOne weird thing was that you had to go up to the side of the bar to place your order.  This made it confusing how to leave a tip.  On the table, or with the person you placed the order with?  \n\nOverall, we enjoyed it here, but we probably wouldn't come back during dinner hour, as the atmosphere was a bit weird for us.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KHOHjA8HOcTlFBCtMQFv8A"}

I live in the Shenk-Atwood neighborhood, so I'm not writing as an outsider. I've been to the Harmony many times, but I'm finally done being abused by the notoriously unfriendly owner, bartenders and waitstaff at the Harmony. The Harmony is worse than Seinfeld's Soup Nazi because there's no irony or humor in being treated the way the employees here treat their customers. \n\nI won't get into specifics. I can only say that I take pride in my neighborhood. My wife and I frequent those establishments that understand that they are part of a community and treat their paying customers as such. The Harmony is a black mark on our neighborhood, and I am ashamed that unsuspecting visitors to the quaint east side should have to endure the abusive, disrespectful and generally unapologetic service at this establishment. If you scroll down you'll read other comments about the owner's girlfriend who is now manager. The last time I was in there with a group of friends, she couldn't have been more rude or insulting. When we all said we wouldn't be back, she merely shrugged her shoulders. \n\nIf you're visiting the East Side, there are plenty of other places that serve great food with friendly service. Alchemy, Mickey's, Wilson's, The Weary Traveller all come to mind as places that will make you feel and taste the love on the East Side.  If you're a masochist, be sure to head on over The Harmony for your daily dose of abuse. \n\nYou've been warned.

At first I thought it was just sarcastic \"Soup Nazi\" humor, but soon realized that the prevalent hostile attitude there is genuine and that it trickles down from management to employees, customers, and even performers.  I've seen bar managers there either berate customers directly or berate the bartenders who then have to try very hard not to pass that negativity on to customers.\n\nAlso, it's downright embarrassing to be an audience member there when the bar mistreats the band.  I once saw a Harmony bar manager preempt an encore performance by turning on the overhead lights, jumping up on the stage, and literally grabbing the mike from a performer to announce that the show's over and that everybody has to finish their drinks and leave.  I was floored.  It was the first time I'd ever seen anyone kick a band off the stage just because they wanted to close their bar early.  \n\nThe kitchen staff works hard, and the food is decent.  Unfortunately, this is the only bar I've ever been to in Madison where I've been asked to pay for my dinner tab up front.  (There are lots of other bars that also don't take credit cards, but they still let you run a tab.) It made me wonder if they didn't trust me to close out my tab or if they were hoping my tip would be better prior to experiencing their poor service.\n\nIn short, even on occasions when they book national acts, it's not worth going there if you're going to encounter hostility when you want something from the bar.  There are too many other fun places to go in Madison for anyone to have to put up with the miserable buzz killing atmosphere that prevails at The \"Harmony\".", "type": "review", "business_id": "KHOHjA8HOcTlFBCtMQFv8A"}

If you go expecting an upscale \"gastro-pub\" experience of chic bar food, then you will be disappointed. There are no waiters, and you seat yourself. You order food and drinks at the bar, and  a food runner brings out your order when it's ready. Its got a dive bar atmosphere, and the interior is pretty run down. \n\nAfter fighting for a table due to the crowd that was rapidly accumulating in anticipation of that evening's band, my friends and I perused the menu. It contains primarily stereotypical bar food (burgers, fries, onion rings, etc), but there are a few exceptions. There are several vegetarian options, including veggie nachos, so if you're a non meat eater, you would probably find lots of things to order at The Harmony. Most notably, The Harmony offers a walnut burger. I'm told they're famous for it, so I ordered the walnut burger with blue cheese and a side of homemade potato chips with \"Bleu Cheese Dip\". (What can I say, I really, really love Blue Cheese!) It took awhile for the food to come out, so we drank beer while we waited. Our table of about 10 people ordered 3 pitchers to share. I am not sure what all of them were, but in honor of the WI bar experience, I stuck to PBR. It was as good as PBR can be.\n\nOnto the food: The blue cheese walnut burger came topped with a creamy blue cheese sauce in addition to blue cheese crumbles, rather than plain blue cheese crumbles like I had been anticipating. It also came with onion, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. The lettuce and tomato were exceptionally fresh and ripe looking. I was really impressed, especially by the tomato (it was actually red!). I bit into it and was immediately transported to blue cheese heaven. It was fantastic. I will qualify this praise with the statement that the reason I loved this burger so much was largely a result of the copious blue cheese flavor. I am not sure the walnut burger itself was why it tasted so great. The chips were also awesome. They arrived piping hot. Some were crunchy and others were chewier. It was clear that they were made to order. The Bleu Cheese Dip they came with was similar to what came on my burger, and as a result, was amazing. \n\nWe ate as the band played and just reveled in how fun the whole experience was. By the way, the band was great! It was a Rockabilly group called The Fast Clydes. If you like that style of music, I couldn't recommend them more. They had a ton of energy and knew how to work the crowd. I had a blast. \n\nAll this said, there are a few things that I think The Harmony could improve upon. First off, the tables in the main dining area are plastic. They're the exact same tables that you played beer pong on in college. I feel like The Harmony excels in spite of its dive bar atmosphere, and not necessarily because of it. Therefore, if they invested just a little bit of money to spruce up the interior, I think they would see a return. The Atwood area is still rocking that hippie vibe, for sure, but more and more, I am noticing newer and more upscale establishments. To me, that says that there's probably a market for it and the times, they are a changin'. Also, I don't mind ordering food and drinks at the bar. However, I think The Harmony would benefit from offering table service, at least during shows on Friday and Saturday night.

Despite the atmosphere, there are some very interesting records to be found in the collection! Very reasonable prices, and many albums are in very good to great (even excellent) condition. The owner can be quirky, but seems generally friendly and helpful. If you're esp. into older jazz or the \"male & female vocal\" genre, I think you'll find the selection quite interesting.

The sauce here is delicious.  The sides here are also some of the best.  The baked beans have little pieces of pork in em and are super tasty.  \n\nIf you're going to the airport its right by the entrance - make a quick stop and you won't be disappointed.\n\nFYI - Jon of Smokey Jon's has won BBQ competitions all over the US.

I drove by this place on my way to work for a YEAR and never thought to stop in. At a glance, it doesn't seem like much. Nestled(snugly) between two other buildings you can almost miss it. \n\nI'm so glad we stopped in! It has that true BBQ joint atmosphere- checkered cloth tables(each complete with it's own roll of paper towels), wood paneling, and Southern blues playing overhead. You order at the counter off of a big overhead wood sign, and they bring piles of saucy goodness to your table. This place is littered with awards for their barbecue. I guess the owner travels and competes(and a lot of times, wins) at national cook-offs.\n\nI got the 1/3 slab rib and beef brisket combo. The ribs were super yummy. Flavor-full, but not too smokey. The brisket was nice too, not too fatty. I would say that the house sauce has that vinegar-like tang. It's sweet and spicy and tart all at the same time. Nice. \n\nMy saucy side dish(aka boyfriend) ordered the turkey, which we both thought was good...but nothing amazing. The sides were really tasty too. The beans were delish, and the sugar-buns(read: fried dough dusted with confectioners' sugar) weren't too bad either.\n\nWe both left with tingling tongues, full bellies, and smiles on our faces.\n\n* just a note--parking in the \"lot\" is super sparse and hard to navigate in and out of...the only drawback!", "type": "review", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ"}

Afterwards I was impressed and absolutely full, but I wouldn't give it the BBQ crown.\n\nI think most of the value here comes from its uniqueness.  Smoky Jon's sits in a small little log-cabin-style shack, and when you walk in you are witness to the plethora of awards they have received from their delicious BBQ fixins.  Soon, you'll discover their own personal sauce (which I hope you slather across your food), and a menu that has item descriptions which make you want to grow a second stomach.  Corn bread, beans, ribs, brisket, pulled pork, etc; all the delectable food you'd expect from a place like this.  I personally had ribs and brisket with corn bread, and I ate every last bite with no regrets.\n\nProblem is, I've had some really good Barbecue in my life, and the overall taste of the food, while good, wasn't great in comparison.  Some of the places I've dined at in Kansas City, for instance, were a step up from this.  Even some of the dishes at Famous Daves could rival Smoky Jon's, although the ribs certainly could not.  \n\nThe rest of my party all had mixed responses.  My girlfriend didn't really care for what she ordered (I can't remember what it was, a sandwich of some sort), and several of them didn't like the smallishness of the place or the service.  The lady was OK, but she was behind the counter mostly and didn't do much to make us feel welcome.  When we walked in we were all really excited to be there and try it, and she was just kind of \"meh.\"  Also, the location is probably the least desirable of any restaurant I've been to in Madison, but that's more relative to where you live or how you feel about certain neighborhoods.\n\nOverall, worth a try and probably one of the better BBQs as far as Madison goes.

The brisket was cut, almost chipped with a tangy/sweet sauce with a little bit of a bite at the end and little bits of onions that were chewy/crunchy. I asked the person taking my order about his recommendations for sides. He said-definitely the fries and the baked beans. The baked beans were delicious! Also sweet with a little kick at the end and then with a little sweetness to it. I just want to take the time right now to say that I hate beans-the consistency of it and the way that they're often overloaded with lard/butter. As mentioned above, yummy and on top of that he said that if I didn't like either of the sides he recommended to let him know and he would get me something else. \n\nI tried the ribs which were so soft that it basically came apart in my fingers, the sauce was consistent throughout.

Clearly the ribs have been highly reviewed so I actually went for the full slab.  Then it was a choice between the chopped pork sandwich and the brisket sandwich, I went for the pork sandwich from my fond memories of the same in Alabama.  Ordering over the phone, everything seemed to go well.  I then arrived about a half hour later.  There was 1 person in front of me who paid and was getting ready to leave when they brought my order to the counter and it was clearly wrong.  They had given my order to the man before me and I had his.  Apparently we both had the same first name.  Now this I was not perturbed by and was okay with, it was what followed that made me give this place 1 star.  So the counter lady tells me she'll take care of me first before resolving his issue, great!  So she charges my card for 64.66 which was clearly way more than I should have paid for 1 slab dinner and 1 pork sandwich + 1 side of fried dough.  Should have been 1/2 that.  I told her and she couldn't understand what I was talking about, I had to over-explain what I ordered and finally got through to her.  She took the bag back to the kitchen area saying some guy would have to deal with fixing this problem.  Now I was getting irritated.  She refunds me around 32 bucks in cash to make up for the overcharge.  I get a new bag of food and am finally done with the transaction, took about 15 mins to resolve.  Fine, I was happy in knowing I had a great dinner to enjoy soon.\n\nSo I come back and begin with the ribs, 1/2 a slab.  From the first taste I was not impressed.  I've had better ribs all over the country from Los Angeles to Alabama to Texas and Chicago.  Seriously?  This place has won all kinds of awards, I don't get it.  Almost every other place I've eaten ribs in my 40+ years of life has been better than this place.  The \"sugar-fried\" biscuits are nothing with nothing, you can get better donuts nearly anywhere, seriously (again).  The fries dipped in the BBQ sauce were the best part by far.  The corn was pretty good too, but still a little over the top on the taste, hard to describe.  So after being disappointed, I checked out the pork sandwich, and oddly enough there were 3 small containers with the sandwich, and somehow it didn't look like pork either.  I examined further, it was chicken, yet another screw-up with my order, wow!  And I ordered fries and mashed potatoes, neither of which was included.  Instead I found off-the-shelf beans, apple sauce (why?) which is not homemade, just spooned out of the jar, and the third container was BBQ sauce, which I didn't need since I bought a whole bottle.  So the other part of my order was completely wrong in every respect.  And note, the chicken was not anything to write home about either.  I drove to the other side of Madison, which was a fairly pleasant 1/2 hour drive, paid around 33 bucks for a very disappointing experience.\n\nI strongly recommend NOT going to this place, unless you like to take risks, maybe you'll like what you find, I know that if this is the best in Madison, I'll have to go elsewhere in the world to find good BBQ.\n\nOh well...", "type": "review", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ"}

We 'd been looking for a good BBQ place in Madison, and Smoky Jon's was the first place we tried.  Needless to say, we won't be trying any place else!\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the great atmosphere in the restaurant.  It's a small place, maybe 15 tables total, and there's blues music playing in the background.  We put our order in at the front window and then grabbed a couple of tables.  We grabbed a couple of tables and didn't have to wait very long before our food was brought out.\n\nOh was the food good.  I ordered a 1/3 slab of ribs and the pulled pork sandwich combo platter.  The pork was piled on it's bun in plentiful quantities.  It was pretty good, the pork had good flavor and my only complaint is that it wasn't quite as tender and juicy as some of the homemade stuff I've had.  The ribs, though, were amazing.  The meat was incredibly tender.  More importantly, though, was that there was a lot of meat on each bone.  I'm used to seeing skimpy ribs get served at restaurants where you're left wanting more after a full rack.  Here, in just 4 bones I found I was very full.  Smoky Jon's sauce was a great compliment to the meat as well.  Good full flavor with a nice little kick at the end.\n\nThe sides were equally excellent.  The baked beans are a must, and I saved mine for the end so that's the flavor I would leave with.  I also had the sugar fried biscuits that were pretty good too.\n\nThe highlight of the meal, though, was something one of my friends had ordered.  The restaurant also had chili available (which may just be a seasonal item).  It was served with a fork rather than a spoon, and with good reason.  I've never seen chili that was that thick and meaty.  I was able to get a taste of it and was floored by how great the flavors were.  It was so good that I almost went back up to order some chili to go for the next day.\n\nSmoky Jon's is a must for BBQ fans in Madison.  The prices are good, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is perfect.  We will be going back sooner rather than later.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ"}

I'd probably rate it at 3.5 stars if I could so that my scores relative to this one would make more sense overall.  But I digress....\n\nI ordered the ribs and a brisket sandwich with the spicy corn and the baked beans for dinner about two weeks ago.\n\nThe verdicts:\n\nRibs = VERY well done.  Tender, pull-off-the-bone and delicious.  The sauce is where you get the refinement too (beyond the smoking process of course, which is an art in itself).  There are a lot of flavors going on in the sauce and it's not overdone in terms of application.  I've eaten BBQ everywhere and this place's ribs stand up with anyone's.\n\nBrisket Sandwich = Boring.  I was told what I was ordering, so kudos to the service because they were dead on.  It was less of a sandwich and more of brisket on a plain roll.  That's fine of course, but for some reason I feel like sandwich doesn't describe this well.  It does remind me of the bare minimum approach you find in many BBQ joints around, but I don't like it there either.  Anyway, the brisket was very tasty and you should just order it on its own.  No point in getting a piece of bread that just hides the taste of good BBQ.\n\nSpicy Corn = Awesome.  Truly delicious stuff, and I plowed through it in 30 seconds.  Perfect amount of spice too.  Wish I had a little more in that serving, but it will bring me back...soooo mission accomplished?\n\nBaked Beans = Awesome.  I asked if they were made in house, I was told that they were and my palate was rewarded with some of the finest baked beans one can find.  Thick, almost pasty (in a good way) and chock full of flavor.\n\nThe only downfalls would be that it's somewhat pricey for what you get, but food is going up everywhere.  I also ordered a sandwich combo, which was a mistake.  \n\nThe service was top notch.  Everything and more was explained to me in detail.  I only have myself to blame for trying that damn sandwich combo.  Please take it off of the menu...your customers are getting punished for ordering it and it takes away from what you do best.\n\nThe decor is nice and very 'southern' in the sense that this is without a doubt a BBQ place.  I liked looking over all of the trophies and reading the articles and seeing the old pictures.  Very cool stuff.\n\nI got mine to go as well, which was quickly brought out to me.  Eating in looks like it would be fun.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ"}

Good barbecue is great.  Smoky Jons is...Good.\n\nI'm in Madison a few times a week for work and we've driven by this place a hundred times and every time said \"We should stop in here\".  We finally did yesterday.\n\nThe interior is nice, an order counter, a few tables, and a log-cabin'esque interior.  An okay place to eat lunch.  The menu is pretty expansive, with a good selection of sandwiches, platters, combos, sausages, sides, desserts, etc.  Whatever you like, meat-wise, you can find it here.\n\nAfter perusing the menu, I decided on the chopped pork shoulder dinner plate.  I should say my family is from Tennessee and I grew up on chopped pork.  I grew up eating at shady back-country Tennessee BBQ places with dirt floors and plank counters and a weathered old man in the back basting a pig.  Barbecue is in my blood.\n\nSmoky Jons was not up to par.  The meat was delicious, but not smoky at all.  You literally could not taste the pit, or the smoke, or the fire.  The sauce was good too, but soooo sweet.  I guess I grew up on a vinegar sauce and I realize that sauce is an intensely regional thing, but this was not what I enjoyed.\n\nThe sides were excellent.  Coleslaw is great.  Beans are perfect.  Sugar biscuits are delish.\n\nHonestly, this is the best BBQ I've had in Madison.  But I've had better at several places in Milwaukee.  And I've had better at countless places in the south.\n\nI know Smokey Jon's is apparently world-renowned for their BBQ so you should probably try it yourself, and honestly I'll probably go back again.\n\nMy favorite though?  No.\n\nA-OK?  Yes, certainly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ"}

I had the spicy chicken, which was just a chicken breast on a bun, with sauce on the side.  That was it, not even a big chicken breast? \n\nMy wife had the turkey sandwich, which didn't appear to be anything special either.  It looked like it was from a grocery store.\n\nKids liked the burger and brats.\n\nWhat I didn't like was the prices, sandwich platters were $8.45 each and drinks were $1.99 each.  Wasted my money on these as they don't give you a drink you can take with you and it's a plastic cup.  \n\nWhat I did like was the sides, except for the one order of fried biscuit, which was raw in the middle.  Threw them out.\n\nLast, I've never been to a BBQ place with no sauces on the table and only one served with the order.  I liked the sauce, but with all of the awards on the wall, they should offer a few options. \n\nShould have gotten the pulled pork.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ"}

I didn't have anymore time and asked them to check my order. Nope, the ticket was lost.\n\nI was so hungry and so sad that I couldn't get any ribs. In the state of chaos that the kitchen and staff was in, there was no way they were gonna rush the order out in time even for to-go. I had to get a refund and speed to the airport. For what it's worth I don't think the 1 woman on wait staff was to blame. The owner really threw her under the bus by understaffing on a busy night. There's so many people, so many orders. There was another girl just taking orders. Just standing and waiting, while the other woman ran back and forth with bags and bags of food. What kind of restaurant is this? It's such a weird sight in a restaurant: one girl running another girl standing.  But at least I know she put my ticket into the kitchen.

You can sit and eat - there are a handful of tables, but then there are also bullet holes in the windows. Since it's Madison, I'm assuming someone put them there for show, but definitely with a real gun, so anyway I'd rather eat at home.\n\nAlso, if you've been doing the House of Cards thing and want that BBQ experience but you don't live in the south, this is the closest you are going to get.

This place is known for its ribs, and it deserves the praise it gets for them. There are some other hits, and some less than stellar items on the menu. \n\nWe got the half slab and jumbo 1/2 chicken dinner to share, which was huge! Big portions, but the chicken was really dry. The ribs were amazing. We also ordered some beef brisket, which is a much smaller portion than the ribs and chicken. If you're not a fan of fatty brisket (like me) than you'll be quite happy with their brisket. No awkward moments of biting into a string of fat and trying to spit it out in front of your date. \n\nThe sides, overall, could be better. But lets be honest, you're not here for the sides. If you don't want to order any sides you'll save about a buck, but it's worth it to venture out and try them. The baked beans were iffy. I heard a lot of good things about them via Yelp, but ours were grey-ish and tasted off. The potato salad is definitely full fat and more mayo based. It's a nice and cool way to offset the kick of BBQ. The french fries are more run-of-the-mill than anything else here. We also tried the fried biscuits after seeing so many people rave about them. Maybe I had too high of expectations? They were good, they tasted a bit like carnival food, but they didn't garner a \"Oh my, I'd eat these every day if I could\" opinion like the ribs did.\n\nThe sauce here is unlike any other BBQ sauce I've ever had. It's a bit chunky and sweeter than usual but has a nice kick at the end. \n\nDefinitely go for the ribs. The brisket is good. Chicken could be better. The sides are hit or miss. We got take-out since the seating is limited. It's also pretty loud there, lots of people talking and loud music.

My husband got the 1/2 chicken and it was fantastic!  The chicken was moist there was a touch of char and the sauce was quite elegant with the meat.  The creamy coleslaw was quite tasty, in fact, if you're a person who loved your mom's creamy coleslaw from the 1960's (it was actually based off a Miracle Whip recipe) then this is the one for you.

Nothing fancy - paper plates, styrofoam cups, etc.\n\nI got a chopped smoked pork sandwich with coleslaw and french fries.  I snarfed a fry to start.  Not very hot... \"warm\", I'd say. But tasty - salty.  Could have been better if fresh, but they'll do.  The coleslaw was the creamiest I've ever had.  The flavor wasn't strong, but it was okay.  Could have used a little salt and pepper - neither to be found.  The pork was tasty - definitely smokey.  The side of sauce made it, however.  Sweet, tangy, spicy.  While I was eating it, I thought \"yeah, it's okay - but I wouldn't rave about it\".  Later, however, thinking back on the meal, I thought, \"you know, that was REALLY good!\"\n\nWhile it doesn't best the BBQ I've had in Memphis, it certainly cuts itself from the same cloth. I'd have it again.  I think my meal was around $9 (no drink - had a water).  I was full, and content.  Mission accomplished!\n\nMy coworker had some ribs, and they looked very good - not too fatty, cooked well.  I would like to go back and try them sometime!\n\nTip:  Limited seating, so show up early (or late!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ"}

Located nearby the airport, the well-lit, wooded interior starts with a pathway that leads to the large overhead menu, the ordering counter, and the dining area. Adding to the d\u00e9cor are the statewide accolades all around the walls. On this evening, the casual atmosphere happened to be unexpectedly subdued, quite unlike the other BBQ restaurants I've visited.   \n\nWe shared a Combination Meal ($17.75) that included our choice of 1/3 Slab, Smoked Pork Shoulder Sandwich, and extra serving of smoked pork shoulder, Cole Slaw, and BBQ Baked Beans. The Slab/Pork Ribs were smoky, tender, and the meat easily peeled off the bones. There was an excellent hint of smoke to deepen its flavor, and that was further enhanced by the BBQ sauce to provide a sweet higher note, strong black peppery secondary, and anchored by a noticeable spicy kick that reverberates with good hops. For the price, there wasn't enough meat on the ribs, but the flavors were still sensational. The dinner roll that this dish came with was sweet, soft, and spongy. I loved it.\n\nThe Pork Shoulder Sandwich was excellent as well. The pork shoulders were tender without one single dry spot--perfectly executed and delicious without the BBQ sauce. The meat was flavorful and deepened by its smoky flavor that coupled perfectly with the well-rounded, full-bodied spicy BBQ sauce. I absolutely loved it except for the buns that turned out flaky with hollow spots and lacking flavor. We finished the meat without getting into the buns very much. This sandwich could have been so much better with a bun of higher quality. \n\nThe BBQ Baked Beans were smooth, sweet, and delicious. The Slaw on the other hand was too wet with a weak texture. Compared to other BBQ joints, their sides could use more varieties such as green beans, collard greens, yam and other possibilities to complement this resounding BBQ. They also have two sauces, and I wished we had the option of trying both at the table.\n\nService was impatient at first, as we were initially tentative and indecisive about our choices. I wished the server could have been much more educational with their strengths and limitations to help us make the right decisions on this very first visit. However, she later became much more warm, accessible, attentive, and helpful towards the middle and end of the meal. Price-wise, their items were pricy with the portions we received. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their Beef Briskets and Chicken Dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ"}

The staff mentioned the pork shoulder and the beef brisket were the top sellers besides the ribs.\n\nThe pork shoulder was pigilicious! The shredded meat was perfectly seasoned with the rub and then hickory smoked which gave its own taste without the addition of the BBQ sauce. It also impressed me because there were was no sign of grease on the pork. The bun was a standard bread bun compared to the sweet roll which accompanied the dinner combination. We took the recommendation of the staff and ordered the extra meat (additional 5 ounces for $3) since were feeling extra carnivorous! The BBQ pork ribs came with five succulent ribs with the meat just waiting to fall off the bone. Each bite had a generous coating of their famous award winning BBQ sauce. \n\nOur dinner combination came with two choices of side orders which we picked the baked beans and cole slaw. Both were served in a small styrofoam cups along with the BBQ sauce. It's easy to see why the BBQ sauce won numerous award because of it's rich, sweet and peppery flavor. I'm not a fan of cole slaw but this one exceed my expectations with its creaminess and was extra cold. The baked beans maintained a firm texture and should be ordered with any meal because the sauce was so addictive.\n\nThe cabin style interior holds 11 tables and is very close to the Madison airport. The actual BBQ pit is located a few miles away from the restaurant. So grab your dental floss and wet naps and eat some authentic BBQ at Smoky Jon's!", "type": "review", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ"}

It had a good flavor though.\n\nThe second time was this month (July 2014) and I got the brisket platter with two sides.  The baked beans were decent.  Nothing special, but tasted fine.  The Mac-n-cheese was pretty good.  There was a lot of cheese sauce in relation to macaroni.  I like a little crunch to my mac and cheese, but this was thick and creamy, which is OK.  The brisket was great.  It wasn't cut paper thin, had a nice smoke ring and was easily pulled apart with fingers.  In other words it was tender and not dry at all.  Much better than the first time I visited.  My only complaint would be they put sauce on the brisket.  I prefer sauce on the side because good barbeque doesn't need sauce and this brisket didn't need sauce.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ"}

There's classic advertisements for old systems and just tons of cool stuff everywhere.\n\nThe same guy who runs the store is in there every time I've been in.

Give it a try!\n\n\nDetailed review:\nI've been craving some pancakes for quite some time and have been on a mission to find the perfect stack.  I've recently tried 'cakes from several Madison eateries and while most have been decent, none have knocked my socks off.\n\nSo, I ventured out to Pat O'Malley's, which is located on the very north side of Truax field.  Or, as some might say, \"in the middle of nowhere.\"  Yes, it's a bit of a drive... and yes, it's a bit difficult to find.  But, it's well worth the effort - believe me.\n\nThe Jet Room is located inside of the aviation building, which (for those not familiar) is where people lucky enough to not have to suffer the pains associated with public air transportation go for their arrivals and departures via private aircraft.  \n\nThe building features a nice lobby, a pilot's lounge, a small gift shop, a vending area, a front desk for travelers, and Pat O'Malley's.  It's spotlessly clean, quiet, and completely opposite of what you'd find at any public airport.  There's plenty of parking available in front of the building.\n\nI entered the smallish diner and was promptly greeted by a friendly hostess and seated at a small table with an awesome view of the airstrip.  Private planes of all types - from small jets to single engine craft - regularly took off and landed during my visit.  It was fun to watch them arrive, taxi, unload, and all of that stuff.  \n\nPat's serves breakfast all day - or until they close, which is around 2:00pm.  Because I arrived at lunchtime, they shared the specials, which sounded (and looked) excellent, but I was there for the pancakes.  \n\nI promptly ordered a coffee, an order of pancakes, and a side of bacon.  After the waitress left, I took note of the food around me, and all of it looked great.  The burgers appeared to be thick and hand-formed.  Many sandwiches featured marbled rye.  The fries and sides were plentiful and appeared to be fresh and crispy.  \n\nI could easily overhear folks talking during their meals and only heard positive comments about the lunch items.  I'll definitely have to head back to check them out.\n\nAfter a very short wait, my food arrived - the pancakes were thick, but as Mio confirmed, light and fluffy.  Butter was served on the side; I lathered the cakes with some of that creamy dairy, splashed on my home-brought 100% real Vermont Maple (grade B, thankyouverymuch), and took a bite.  \n\nThe two plate-sized cakes quickly absorbed the syrup, which made for a delightfully tasty combination.  The pancakes, while substantial, weren't heavy or overwhelming.  A hint of buttermilk provided just enough \"bite\" to the syrup.  Mmmmm - definitely a good experience.\n\nBut the hidden star was the bacon.  It was perfectly cooked; crispy, but slightly chewy.  Thick, but not too thick.  Perfect balance of everything: salt/smoke, thickness/chewiness, and not at all greasy or fatty.  Win.\n\nThe check came - $8 for my meal of cakes, bacon, and coffee.  Service was excellent - the waitress was quick on the coffee fills, made sure my food was ok, and promptly delivered the check and my change.  A $4 tip seemed totally fair for such an excellent experience (plus it was a slow Monday).\n\nPat O'Malleys = WIN\n\nFood = 4.25 stars\nValue = 4 stars\nService = 4 stars\nMISC = 4.5 stars \n\nI'd probably avoid this place during the weekend rushes - it would likely fill-up quickly.  But the food, service, and environment are all top notch, so any wait is well worth it.  Do yourself (and your tastebuds) a favor and visit the fine folks at Pat O'Malley's Jet Room - you'll be glad you did.", "type": "review", "business_id": "j515klfbCAEF3KPiKvHz9g"}

They do have a ton of equipment available, but that's about it.\n\nI arrived on Saturday morning with my reservation for a 17' truck firmly in-hand. There was a line of people waiting to check-in/check-out equipment, and only one person working behind the counter. \n\nThe employee (a younger gentleman) appeared to be struggling with everything he did, and he wasn't shy about hiding his frustrations. After waiting for around 15 minutes, another employee (I believe he's the manager) jumped-in and helped folks. The manager was much more proficient, helpful, and friendly. I was third or fourth in line, and the manager processed all of us before the other guy finished his first customer.\n\nWhen I went to get my truck, there was an equipment problem, so they substituted another truck for me. Unfortunately, the truck that I was provided was ancient - it had 204,000 miles on it, the check engine light was on, and it ran so poorly that I thought I was going to breakdown at several points along the way. The steering components were so loose that the truck weaved and swerved the entire time; I could \"saw\" the steering wheel from the 9:00 to 3:00 position as I drove without affecting my direction/course.\n\nBecause of the check engine light, the truck averaged 3.2 miles to the gallon. My 46 mile round-trip move required 15-gallons of fuel to complete. That is absolutely absurd. The cost to refill the truck was $50 on the dot.\n\nEven more absurd were the fees for the truck... $29.95 for the day, $14 for insurance, and $1.09 per mile seem fair. Until they tack on additional service fees, etc. What should've cost around $70 - $80 for an in-town move cost nearly $100 + $50 for gas. \n\nReturning the truck was even worse, as the manager was long gone, and the lone dude was back at the counter. As soon as another employee arrived to assist with the line of people waiting to check-out, the first dude announced that he was \"f-ing out of here\" because he had \"the longest f-ing day of his life\" working there. Mind you, there were 5-6 people in line when he made his proclamation. \n\nI now remember why I've always used Penske or Budget when moving.

I loooove breakfast.  Love it.  Sometimes, I get really overwhelmed by large, fancy menus.  So you can imagine, what a breath of fresh air, the Cottage Cafe was.  \n\nWe walked in at 9 am.  Early, but not too early.  The place was packed.  Wow.  I walked up to the register and little did I know, but it is a seat yourself place.  There was no sign.  So we waited a few minutes for a table to open and sat down.\n\nI am a simple person, I ordered the special of biscuits and gravy with two eggs.  The menu had quite a few other options.  My husband ordered the steak, two eggs and hash browns.  $8.  This is probably the most expensive item on their menu.\n\nMy gravy was perfect.  It was thick without being sludgy.  It had the right amount of seasoning.  I received my breakfast on two plates because the biscuits and gravy were overwhelming a single plate.   I ordered scrambled eggs.  They were bland and flat.  I spied my neighbors omelette which looked much more appetizing. \n\nOur whole bill (for two people) was $16 and some change.  Bottomless coffee and breakfast.  Wow.  \n\nOh, parking is tough.

Twice I became ill.   I am not exaggerating.   When Gaylord's shows up somewhere I get the coffee and a roll.\nFrom my experience the dishes are always of the lowest quality.   \nNote that everything looks ok but often the hot dishes are not hot. \nThis is not criticism of the staff.  Just the quality of the food is always disappointing.\n\nupdate: I was contacted by Gaylord Catering regarding my review.  I think this shows that the owners care about the quality of their food and service and that they have much more sense that many other businesses out there that seem to ignore their negative reviews and cannot even update and maintain a decent website.  (a whole other topic)\nIn response I want to better describe what I am referring to in my previous review.  Everything has always been neat and clean with Gaylord.  Their food has never had a bad or spoiled taste.  My illness has nothing to do with food poisoning or anything like that.  I have just felt nauseous for a while after eating their catered breakfasts.  I really think they need to change up their eggs, sausage and breakfast potatoes.  Everything looks ok but it never sits well with me for the next hour.\nI have eaten some lunches that have been ok and I never became ill after eating a Gaylord's catered lunch.\nAs I briefly mentioned in my previous review the staff is at no fault.  In fact, Gaylord has always been on time, the staff is neat and professional and everything is presented nicely.\n\nAnyone who is selecting a catering service should taste test a complete meal that is being served before ordering the service.   I have experienced some real nightmares at weddings, funerals and family reunions. Gaylord Catering has never presented a dish like some of the bad dishes I have been served over the years by other catering services.  I have been served raw meat in Milwaukee, spoiled fish in Waukesha, cold and two hour late food in southern Wisconsin, over salted meatballs in West Allis, tv dinner style food in Montana, seriously low quality seafood in Oregon, completely cold food in West Virginia and a 6 dollar meal for the cost of 20 in Madison,  Complaining about disappointing food at a catered meal is bad manners in my book so I just pass the poor servings and eat what I can.  But on Yelp I can express what my real experience was and I try my best to be as constructive and fair as possible.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gzZsvqloSosWREQMHCm75Q"}

I think we were expecting a normal ice cream shop kind of atmosphere, with a big case of flavors to look at, so we had a bit of a deer-in-headlights moment when we first walked in, trying to figure out what we were supposed to order. It turns out they only have 3 flavors (vanilla, chocolate, and one other) per day, and most of your choices come from what sort of sundae you get. Once we figured that out, a number of the sundae choices seemed pretty solid. I ended up going with Turtle, and my husband got the Peanut Butter Cup. Both were excellent. The chocolate shell on the PBC was nicely chocolaty, especially for that kind of a product, and I appreciated that they didn't skimp on the pecans for the Turtle. We both had smalls, which were QUITE ample. We also got a K9 custard for our dog, which she appeared to enjoy. \n\nI guess I just have a couple of objections that keep this from being a 4-star place. First, I wish they had more flavors, since I don't always want a sundae (but maybe this is characteristic of frozen custard joints and is not a fair criticism). Second, I think it should be served slightly colder so that it doesn't melt as fast when the hot fudge hits it. Third, I felt that it was a bit overpriced for a fast food-style place. This is especially true of the K9 custard, since we're used to getting something more along the lines of a 79-cent kiddie cone for the dog. We'll probably be back, since its in the neighborhood, but this will not be the last frozen dessert purveyor I visit in Madison.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Jb5SB2OXbRW0e7ErGlMK-Q"}

This is a public service announcement.  I do not even know you and I like you too much to suggest this place.\n\n1- Prices?!  Are you kidding me?  $6 for a milkshake?  It was tiny.  Not to mention it was not much of a milkshake.  It was a peanut butter cup shake.  They took some peanut butter cups, crushed them and stirred them into custard with some milk.  I saw the whole process.  It was not very impressive whatsoever.  The flavor was ok.  \n\n2 - The food.  I had a chili cheese dog.  This is my standard order when it is available on the menu.  The chili tasted like Hormel.  The hot dog was hot and the chili was warm.  I like that they have shredded cheese on it, rather than liquid cheese.\n\n3 - My dining companion got a burger.  It tasted ok, but it was a very thing patty. He also ordered cheese curds with it.  They were so greasy and lacked any good flavor in the breading.  \n\nOverall, we spent nearly $20 there and I was not satisfied with my meal.  Every talks so much about how great the custard is.  Nope.  Not good.  Go to Culver's!  Seriously, for $6 you can get something TWICE the size with more mix-ins.  Better yet?

Unfortunately they  have the market cornered for laundry pick-up and delivery service in Madison so at this point we really don't have the option of finding someone else. Maybe because Lazybones primary caters to students (what student can afford this??) they think they can do a terrible job at customer service and nobody will notice. They picked up our laundry on Monday. It was supposed to be delivered on Tuesday. It was not. We made sure that they had our waiver so they can leave it on the porch. It was not delivered on Wednesday. I get home yesterday evening (Thursday) and lo and behold, NO LAUNDRY! Really people? Okay I'm out of underwear. Of course by the time you get home and discover that they did not deliver your clean laundry, once again, the office is closed! They attempted to deliver on Wednesday at 3:30 and, despite our waiver, did not just leave it on the porch. The reason why we are using this service is because my husband and I are NOT HOME often. Via email and phone calls we tried to work this out all week and we thought they were clear on our needs but, alas, I am still underwear-less.\nAs I mentioned, there is no other business like this in town, so we are really hoping they pull it together and we can make it work.

Luxury is yachts. Luxury is stretch limousines. Luxury is diamond tiaras and Rolex watches. Luxury is Bentleys and Beverly Hills; bone-in filets and \"bon appetite\". Luxury is throwing some glitter and making it rain.\n\nI once thought luxury in its truest form was to only be attainable by the rich and the powerful - but boy was I wrong. People -- luxury IS attainable. I know this, because I recently experienced it at the Country Inn and Suites outside of Madison, WI. \n\n Whether you opt for an \"inn\" or spring for a \"suite\" - you're going to love this fucking hotel. Upon entering the palatial lobby, a charming bellman presented me with my own personal luggage dolly, even though it was clear that my strapping, young body was more than adequate to carry my small, nylon duffle bag. The Sconnie at the front desk even put me up on the top floor of the resort (floor 3), which offered views of one of the most gorgeous bodies of water I had ever seen. \n\nThe ice bucket was a nice touch. It was large, though not too large as to take up much of the expansive counter space the room provided. There was even a plastic liner for the bucket--which I scoffed at. To think, who would even consider using it in such a pristine, meticulously manicured suite? I quickly tossed it, and when I did I couldn't help but notice the luxurious mini-fridge down below. Let me tell you, there was nothing \"mini\" about this fridge. I fit an entire case of Coors Light in there, along with some Gatorade, and cheese curds to boot. It looked so cool and cozy that, at the end of the evening, I wanted to curl up and sleep in there.\n\nThough it wasn't easy -- I refrained from sleeping in the mini-fridge. I mean, how could I sleep in there with one of the most luxurious beds I had ever seen staring me in the face? You could fit John, Kate, and the 8 on this bed. I never would, though. I'd kick them all out and keep all of the fresh pillows and down comforters to myself-- because THAT'S luxury, and Kate is mean. If it wasn't for a call of nature which I battled until my bladder nearly exploded on all of the luxurious bedding, I might STILL be laying in that fluffy wonderland of extravagance. \n\nNow, I've peed in some nice bathrooms... very nice bathrooms actually. Once, I came across a bathroom SO nice, I couldn't pee in there. I held it, and peed in my less fortunate bathroom at home-- but this bathroom? This bathroom was so luxurious; I HAD to pee in it. I couldn't unzip my fly fast enough (literally, I peed a little in my pants). Thankfully there was a cornucopia of fine soaps and lotions at my disposal. I would bet that royalty uses these same soaps - they just had that royal smell about them. When I was done drying my hands, I squirted a little more of that soap on them and didn't even wash it off.\n\nSummary: In hindsight, this is really only a place you want to stay at if you're celebrating something really special-- a honeymoon, for instance, or a significant wedding anniversary.

I'm trying to switch my cats to a grain-free diet, and while the cats are resisting, Mounds has offered me lots of options! So wonderful.\n\nI'm not actually familiar with Mounds as a company, but from the tiny bit of research I've done--and the newsletter they gave me--it looks like they are really working to make a difference in the Madison/Southern Wisconsin area. And for that, they at least deserve thumbs up. \n\nThat said, this location is a bit hard to navigate. I had to wander through the dog food to find the cat food, and the toys were in a totally random spot. Once I found them, though, I was fine. I think the store could use a bit more lighting or something to make it feel a little less dungeon-like, but it's not like you're running around in the dark or anything, either.\n\nAs for service, I'm really split. This is where the half-star comes in. While the cashiers have always been friendly while I check out, and the first time I was there I had someone ask if I needed help finding anything (which was the time I didn't, as I was legitimately just wandering around), I've not had any additional offers of help, and the employees I see around the store seem a bit stand-offish.

He thanked me for my patience and went along. \n\nAgain, we went to the pump and the worker finished pumping up the front tire. I proceeded to ask him if he would squeeze the back tire to see if it needed air too. He refused to do it, telling me that I 'should know how to do it.' He told me that 'this is a simply life skill that I should already know how to do'. Huh? \n\nI said, 'In your professional opinion, would you suggest that I add more air to the tire?'. He replied with a short, crisp, snotty attitude, \"you feel the front tire and it (the back tire) needs air, do it\". Wow!!!!!\n\n...and he walked back in the store, leaving me by myself. \n\nI'm serious, I stood there shocked and wondering what was happening.\n\nI am an African American professional who wanted to take my nephew on his first Monona-lake bike ride.

I used to be heavily involved in bike racing about 20 years ago, but becuase of the sport changing so much to this date, I once again went to the Village Peddler to ask the experienced and knowledgeable staff at VP. Having two boys changing from BMX style to Mountain bikes, I had no idea what to look for size wise. Gary showed both boys the different bikes and took the time to explain the differences. When each of them picked out the style of bike that they liked the most, Gary measured each of them and suggested the correct size knowing that they will need room to grow. In comparing two other bikes stores, their sale prices were still more than Village Peddler everday prices, can you say mark-up!\n\nEach of the boys were taught how to assemble and dissasemble their tires making sure to check the brakes to allow them for a seamless ride.Gary went over this a couple times to make sure the boys were comfortable to do it on there own, then asked them both to do it by themselves. After about two times, they are pros! I was impressed as I sat back and watched the interaction between the boys, Gary, and newly joining in on the conversation; Mike. It was impressive to see that both of the boys fealt comfortable and were totally ingaged with Gary and Mike like they had known them for years. It was obvious that both the men have kids and could relate specifically on a personal level before professional. Both Gary and Mike spent about 25 minutes with them, which in this day and age doesn't happen in the big corporate run stores. I have been in customer service myself for over 20 years, so it definitely takes a lot to impress me! \n\nI have visited other bike stores where we were just treated like a number, when finally asked if we needed help it was if the clerk was being timed to make sure he could get back to the next person in line. When I am considering spending a large amount of money, if I am not impressed with your customer service, you have definitely lost the sale. In this case, we as a family were treated excellent, and coming from a guy in his 40's, I don't find many places that are willing to make a good personal experience great, but in the case it most definitely was. \n\nWe added several accessories to our purchase and all together spent far less than we would have elsewhere. Once we were done, both guys wheeled the bikes out and helped us secure them in the truck conveinently out a side door of their shop. While in the store, I picked out a couple of bikes that I am intersted in, and soon as have time, you can bet that I am going to head back and buy the one that makes the most sense. When I have a good experince shopping, I tend to tell everyone I know, and this time will be no different.

No card, no money left their hand.  What?

They are like, it is just brownies.  My response: Anything else?  They had to go ask someone.  What?  Seriously?!  So I finally get my answer and order it.  My husband also ordered a blizzard.  He ordered a Turtle Pecan blizzard and received some random peanuts in his blizzard.  We never got a receipt.  When I asked for one, they said they did not have any.  What?!\n\nWe pay and wait.  And wait.  Oh, but while we wait, we get to watch the kitchen person.  He was making a chicken sandwich.  With his LONG ponytail hanging over the grill.  Yum?  More like gross.  Then both my husband and I notice that he grabbed a raw chicken breast (while not wearing a glove) and placed it on the bare counter.  He then wiped his hand on his pants.  What?  Salmonella much?  Any food standards?\n\nWe get our medium blizzards.  The ice cream normally extends to the top or slightly over the top of the cup.  This time the ice cream barely made it to the top of my cup. My husband had ice cream under the cup.  When we asked if this was a medium, they said yes.

It is known for its barbecue. Last Friday night, I did not go for the barbecue. I went for a fish fry. No, that is not really true. I went for the Cajun Potato soup, but more on that later.\n\nDo not get me wrong about why I was at Fat Jack's. I love all types of barbecue. But this is Wisconsin and it was Friday night. Most of the Wisconsin population will go out for fish on Friday night, not all, but most do. We were with friends and the vote was for fish. Fat Jack's was close and we had not been there for some time. And our friends were never there, so we pulled into Fat Jack's.\n\nWe all ordered the Friday Night Fish Fry. One thing I like about their Fish Fry is you can get their steak fries or their beans or Red Rice and Beans as a side. The four of us tried them all and all the sides were all good. The fish was done well with not too much batter, a trait I like in a Fish Fry. Their coleslaw is very good, but I would like more with my fish. Overall, Fat Jack's has a very good Wisconsin Friday Night Fish Fry.\n\nNow really why I was at Fat Jack's and that was for their Cajun Potato soup. It is just marvelous. I could just stop for the soup. It is spicy, but not overbearing. There are chunks of potato and the soup is thick, but not too thick. It has the color of toast that is not too dark. The taste is just great. Order a bowl and you will want more. The Cajun Potato soup is definitely five star.", "type": "review", "business_id": "spiYqne1kXzYQxDTZfKt2g"}

Not feeling in the mood for the typical brat, hot dog or hamburger selection, I decided on the offerings at the Fat Jack's table under the tent. They had jambalaya and a pork sandwich. The jambalaya was excellent, hot with heat and with the right amount of spice, with nice chunks of vegetables and meat. The pork had the black crust on the outside that you look for when you are looking for barbecue.  I was most happy, decided then and there to check out the restaurant. Dad and I went there for lunch. Dad got the special, which was chicken and meatballs over biscuits, and I got the combo lunch platter, where I chose the pork ribs and sliced pork with beans and cole slaw on the side. The cole slaw was homemade, as were the beans. The pork was delicious, needing only a small amount of the mild sauce to give it a little kick. Include with both meals was a large slice of crusty garlic bread. The place was very clean, including the bathrooms, without the sticky table syndrome that you get in some barbecue places. The iced tea was not chemical tasting and the waitress was attentive and pleasant. The only drawback was that the music was cranked a little loud, but all and all, a very pleasant place to have lunch if you are in the mood for barbecue. Apparently, they serve the jambalaya for their Wednesday special. We will be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "spiYqne1kXzYQxDTZfKt2g"}

It took a full week to get a quote on the appliances we discussed in the store. Since we are under a bit of a time crunch with the builder, that was not helpful. We called the store four times to request the quote (after waiting 5 days we called, and were told that we would have the quote by the end of the day. It didn't come.

However, this review is mostly based off of a shopping experience that I undertook there.\n\nI was in the market for a couch and shopped around at a lot of places, wasn't looking for anything too fancy or expensive. Someone gave me a tip that Menards was selling a decent one for $250 so I went in to check it out (this was their East Towne location). After giving it a day of thought I decided to pull the trigger. I called the east side and they said they only had the floor model left (they were priced to sell). I asked if their other two locations had some in stock, and they said the west side did, so I called the west side and had one put on hold so I could buy it that evening.\n\nGet to the west side and they have the loveseat, not the couch. ARGGG, I thought these things were organized by SKU, you messed up on the store computer on that one, East Side. The Monona location still has one left though! It's the floor model, but now it's $200 (after $50 rebate). OK, fine. I go to the Monona location and ask if I can buy it now and pick it up in a few days when I can borrow my dad's trailer and haul it to my apartment. They say \"No\" we don't do prepay anymore. Darn. I ask if I can put it on hold and my dad can alter his schedule so that he can pick it up tomorrow morning (this was a deal on a couch that I didn't want to let get away). The sales associate calls his manager and they make a big exception for me. That I'm happy with, and I commend them for being flexible.\n\nHowever, I go to put it on hold, and they say that I need to pay for it now when I put it on hold. What??? So you first say that Menards doesn't do prepay (pay now, pick up later), but when I put something on hold to buy and pick up later, I have to pay now? What's the difference???\n\nAnyway, I'm happy that I found such a deal, and I'm happy that they were willing to make a small exception to their rules, but Menards you really need to get your stuff together.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SqdO4jenDHNwHeSKmULPrA"}

I get that they want you to wander through and maybe pick up random crap, but when all you need is bags on concrete it's annoying to have to make that trek. The new checkout lines are set up in a really dumb way.

We went to the Rubin's Clearance Center and happened to catch their moving sale, which meant that everything was marked down below their normal clearance price. Nice! You won't pay Ikea prices, but this is, for the most part, high-quality stuff. Real leather, real wood (for most items), etc. There are a few with scratches and dents, and many items are floor models, but for the most part, that doesn't bother me. We got a really good deal on a chair that apparently someone had ordered but came with the wrong fabric. We also left with a shelf/storage unit/drawer thing, a desk, and a rolling chair. The manager threw in a few gift-y items I had picked out, too. \n\nThe downside is, the salesperson (not the manager), kept reminding us that it was \"20 minutes until closing time.\" This started a half hour before (believe me, I used to work in retail, and I know the \"oh, you have a half hour before we close\" trick). We were out of there ten minutes before they closed, so it's not like we were making them stay late. If you're making commission on a sale which could be several thousand dollars (it ended up under 2K, but still), you shouldn't be pushing people out the door. I might have picked up a couple of other items if I hadn't felt rushed out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JU1ITL_GIF3wmkIdCO_Ztg"}

I can't say for certain when my clan first trucked out to Monona, but it started a trend that has kept up through the years.  In reality Angelos is a perfectly serviceable Italian-style family restaurant that does pizza and pasta amongst other things, but I couldn't tell you about anything other than the white pizza.  Over the last decade plus I can't remember a single time when I didn't order the same thing.  Normally this would be boring and I'd feel disappointed in myself for such unimaginative thinking, but in the case of Angelo's my nostalgia trumps all.  And it isn't exactly like I'm here every week - I don't make it out to Monona all that often, and I'm lucky if I grace Angelo's with my presence two times in one year.  But when I do, I'm in white pizza heaven.  It's not the be-all, end-all when it comes to pizza, but there's something to the combination of sausage, artichoke hearts, olives and alfredo sauce that is simply amazing.  It's close to my favorite singular meal in the Madison area, and when I think about it I'm tempted to slap down five stars for the pizza alone.  \n\nI made my latest trip to Angelo's a week or so back, and it marked the first time I'd been since they went smoke-free.  It's a definite improvement, to be sure.  I was, however, saddened to see that the dining room had been renovated.  It looks perfectly nice, if a bit generic, but before it had real atmosphere.  The walls had been lined with bottles of chianti, the fiaschi (the bottles with straw baskets - I looked that up) decorated by past diners over the years.  It was tradition to order a bottle of chianti and document the occasion with a message or a sketch.  I was told by the waitress that the bottles had deteriorated beyond repair and had to be taken down.  I'd always hoped that one of those bottles had my writing on it.\n\nAs much as I love Angelo's, my last trip was just a bit disappointing in terms of service.  The white pizza was excellent as always, but we were left without drink refills for a bit too long.  Maybe it was because it was at the tail end of the night, but the waitstaff came off a bit brisk and the overall vibe wasn't as enjoyable as before.  But maybe that's just me, maybe it was the newness of the dining room that made the night stick out.  Still, Angelo's without the nostalgia remains a pretty decent place, and the first bite of white pizza reminds me of why I'll always keep coming back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Hld3cjWyfPpW5hDcgXfNQA"}

Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first.  \n\n- It's pricey.  I recently bought 2 sea scallops, a pound of Halibut, and a 6-oz Tuna fillet.  Price: $50.86.  Ouch.\n\n- Limited selection of \"staple-goods.\"  Sure, I can get fresh Alaskan King Crab or a locally-made vegan cookie from the bakery at a moment's notice, but I dare you to find a box of Blueberry Special K on a Sunday night... I think they stock 4 or 5 of those, and when they're gone, they're gone (they're also about $1 higher than Woodman's).\n\n- It's inconvenient to get in and out of.  University Avenue S-U-C-K-S sucks.  And, if you wish to head west from Metcalfe's, you have to turn onto Midvale, make a U-turn, and then sit at the Midvale/University light and wait... The parking lot is also a cluster-F.\n\n- The checkers can be a bit snooty.  That, or I get the same girl every time... it really does seem as though I'm bothering the heck out of her by giving her a handful of items to scan, waiting on a total, and then giving her money.  I usually encounter a \"why-are-you-bothering-me-with-this\" sigh or a roll of the eyes at some point during checkout.  \n\n- The clientele can be a bit snobby (especially the ones that hop out of their leased BMWs).  Yeah, so you think you're cool in your BMW, but we both know that you're living in a rundown apartment, using one credit card to pay the other, and you're maybe 2-weeks from having the Bimmer repo'd.  Get over yourself... and flip your collar down and straighten that hat - you look ridiculous, fratty.  Ok?\n\n\nAnd now for the good stuff.\n\n+ The service workers (Deli, bakery, etc) are fantastic.  Very knowledgeable and helpful.  Makes it seem a little less painful when you're paying $28.99/lb for fish or buying a $4 cupcake.\n\n+ Fruits and Veggies are usually top notch quality.\n\n+ They place an emphasis on locally sourced products.\n\nSo there you have it.  As others have mentioned, there are many better alternatives for regular day-to-day items: Woodman's, for one.  But for those times when you need something that's extra fresh, or a little obscure, check out Metcalfe's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OxR3b_qcMJlzwzGPU5fmdA"}

It was definitely a bit more than I'd usually pay for trays of meats, cheeses, and the like, but I chalked this up to a wedding expense and didn't think much of it.\n\nCome the day of the wedding, I was happy hitched and getting photos taken when I get a call \"Hi, this is SoAndSo from Metcalfe's and I have a delivery.\" \"Yes,\" I say. \"I'm the bride and I'm not there. There are 2 planners on site as well as venue staff.\" \"But I'm at the back door and no one is here. I have a delivery,\" says Metcalfe's dude. \"I'm not there! I've just gotten married.

I got a dirty look.  When I later spoke to the person managing the venue for our reception, he had a laughable mention about the delivery guy as well.

I am new to Madison and everyone can't stop talking about what an experience it is to shop here. It's the fine-dining of grocery shopping. Well, I have only been shopping like a grown up for about a year now - but I learned how to do it in Denver. So the bar was set pretty high through Whole Foods and Safeway. But I can safely say that my experience at Metcalfe's topped it.\n\nIt was very clean and well stocked. I believe I went on a Friday night too. The main goal was to get some fresh meat and milk; let's face it - those are two items you don't want to get from an Aldi's or a Woodman's. I was told by a friend that I was lucky to live so close to it, but to be careful because it was expensive. WRONG, not expensive (or maybe Denver was expensive, so that word has become relative).\n\nSafeway had a discount meat section because it was within a few days of expiring (cook it that night and you're fine). Now, I wasn't looking for that at Metcalfe's (I don't know if they'd have that even), but I found $2 Pork Butt Steak (which, the mere name of the steak made me question it - but for $2 I'll try anything once). Delicious, and I won't go as far as to say I'm a great cook.\n\nOf course I also got some stuffed pork chops and fresh produce. But the experience I had was very pleasant and the prices were fair for the quality of food I was buying (dare I say, I thought prices should be higher).\n\nAs for the atmosphere, I don't think I've gone to a store in a long time that played classical music. I almost feel like if I came in sweatpants and a t-shirt that I would be under-dressed to get groceries.\n\nWhole Foods ain't got nothing on Metcalfe's (leave my double negative alone).", "type": "review", "business_id": "OxR3b_qcMJlzwzGPU5fmdA"}

For example, if you choose buttercream for your frosting, it will be smooth and sweet and creamy awesomeness in your mouth -- but on the cake, any colors will run and it can't hold complex shapes, so you're limiting yourself to very simple designs. Other frosting options exist, such as fondant and rolled white chocolate, and they each have their own set of benefits and limitations as well.\n\nIf you're good at research, you have some time to kill and you know what you're looking for, you can find a lot of this information on-line -- but when you're in the midst of the overwhelming task of planning a wedding, it would be so, so much easier to just sit down with a professional who can lay out all your options and explain the benefits and limitations of each one.\n\nUnfortunately, you won't find anyone like that at Carl's Cakes. Oh, Carl seems friendly, helpful and optimistic when you first meet him. The samples he gave us at our cake tasting were better than I ever knew cake could be, and when we asked about decorations, he was quick to assure us that he could \"do anything you want\". \n\nAfter our initial meeting with Carl, we surfed the Net for examples of memorable wedding cakes and cherry-picked the ideas we liked best until we had put together the perfect cake design. I'll admit it was on the moderately complicated side, but nothing exceptional by wedding cake standards; and after Carl's repeated assurances at the tasting that he could \"do anything you want\", we thought we were safe.\n\nBut once he has your deposit, his attitude changes. He's difficult to get ahold of by phone, and impossible to get ahold of by email. Suddenly, any design requests more complicated than the average birthday cake are answered with a simple \"I can't do that\". Even something as simple as multiple colors will be refused on the basis that the colors will bleed together. He never tries to suggest compromises or alternatives, and if you ask for them, he'll only tell you to come in and pick something from his generic book of designs.\n\nWhy all the limitations? Because Carl frosts his cakes with buttercream frosting -- and ONLY buttercream frosting.\n\nI've lost track of how many hours we spent on the phone going back and forth with Carl over the cake design, struggling to find something he could do that didn't leave us cold. Dealing with him wasted a large portion of the limited time we had to plan our wedding, and drastically increased our stress during an already stressful time. If I was rating his business purely on Customer Service, I'd have to give him 1 star.\n\nBut I'll also give credit where credit is due. In the end, he delivered our cake on time, in the flavors, size and design that we eventually agreed to. It was beautiful, if vastly simplified from our original design, and the flavor? To this day, our wedding cake is still the best thing I've ever had in my mouth. If I were rating his business purely on taste, I'd have to give him 5 stars. Heck, I'd give him 6 if it were possible.\n\nSo if you want the best cake you've ever had in your entire life, consider Carl's Cakes -- But consider very carefully. Give him an exact cake design and make ABSOLUTELY SURE he can do it without modifications BEFORE you give him a dime.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tE8MQ9I7E2_Xvm4AvykXrw"}

Perhaps the term \"buttercream\" is used loosely outside of Europe, but true buttercream is not a concoction of Sweetex (sweetened shortening, commercial grade) and some other fake ingredients.

If you want a simple cake, and don't mind that it is frosted with fake buttercream because that's what is more shelf stable and easy to work with, then go to Carl's.\n\nI see that since I posted my review Deb R. from Carl's Cakes commented.  Thanks for your comment and those pictures.  I can definitely tell which ones Carl decorated as opposed to other cake decorators working there.  The cakes with a very simple piping design and love birds have Carl written all over them.  The cakes that are more creative and interesting are done by other people.  Oh, and you guys must go through a TON of shortening for all that \"buttercream\"!", "type": "review", "business_id": "tE8MQ9I7E2_Xvm4AvykXrw"}

When my husband and I first met with Carl, my husband and I mentioned we wanted a pink cake (as close to fuchsia as possible) with white decor. We understood if it wasn't exactly fuchsia but just didn't want a pastel pink cake. Carl explained that he probably couldn't get the pink to be as deep as we'd like. He showed us some not so great looking pastel pink cakes. I asked if he could go any deeper with the color and he was hesitant. I appreciated that he was being up front at our initial tasting and consultation. But, nevertheless, we loved the taste and decided to use Carl. \n\nI stopped back in several months later to talk about decor and finalize what we wanted. At that time I brought in a sample of the pink color we wanted. He again stated that he probably couldn't get as vivid as that color and in general talked me out of what I wanted for decor. Instead, he talked me into a white cake with pink decor. I showed him a picture of an IDEA of what I wanted for decor, but explained instead of hearts and vines (such as what the picture had), I wanted vines, piped flowers and music notes hidden amongst the vines. I didn't have a picture because it didn't exist.\n\nThe day of my wedding came, and when I saw the decor on the cake, I was not impressed. Whoever decorated that cake didn't listen to me at all. It looked exactly like the picture I gave them as \"inspiration\" and not like I described. Also, the pink they used for the decor would have been just fine for a pink cake with white decor like I initially wanted. But that one was my fault and I should have stuck to what I wanted. The reason the white frosting with pink decor did not look good is because my cake topper was slightly off white, which would not have been as noticeable with pink frosting and white decor. It looked so bad that I didn't even print the picture of the cake in color. \n\nTo recap, cake color was not necessarily Carl's fault. I should have stuck to what I wanted. However, the cake decor was just hideous and even though I printed a picture of the cake (in black and white), I don't have it displayed anywhere. Not even in my wedding book. Unfortunately, it has almost been two years since my wedding and this little wedding cake still bothers me a bit, enough to write a review after the fact. I was at a wedding show today and saw Carl's Cakes there and the decor I saw on the cakes looked much better than it did two years ago, and spurred this little review. It makes me wonder if they've hired new cake decorating talent who could have given me what I wanted in my wedding cake. Oh well, at least everyone raved about how good the cake tasted at my wedding.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tE8MQ9I7E2_Xvm4AvykXrw"}

In fact, they were all similar: cake pretty average, all topped with a very strange frosting -- buttercream that is TOO buttery, overpowering in both flavor and fragrance, and has an odd, chemical-like flavor to it. \n\nAfter I eat a slice of the cake, I'm not tempted to go back for more. (It's cake! You should be!) Because of the strange buttercream frosting, I've really had enough when I've eaten just one small slice.\n\nEvery instance in which I've had a slice of a Carl's Cakes cake was at my work (someone's birthday or other event). The cakes sat in the kitchen room at my work, ready for staff people to enjoy. The kitchen room itself smelled like butter with the cake sitting in the room. It is a sickly sweet smell and kind of nauseating, I think. (I've never noticed other sheet cakes from other cake bakers that cause the room to fill with the smell of the frosting.)\n\nI hate to be harsh about cakes, but I just have never had an enjoyable experience eating any cakes from Carl's Cakes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tE8MQ9I7E2_Xvm4AvykXrw"}

I tried a small bite was amazed! Spent the course of the day trying to find out who brought this amazing cake and where it is from!  Turns out Carl's cakes and the flavor I tried was hazelnut apricot.\n\nI went to see what they offered at the market street diner in terms of variety. I was please that they have 4 or 5 cakes that you can get individual slices from but also a cooler with ready to go full cakes in a variety of flavors. I ended up getting a hazelnut apricot cake good for about 8 to 10 people for only 16 bucks. What a steal! Where can you get a awesome cake for that price nowadays. \n\nThey also do cheesecakes which I know will lure me back at some point.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tE8MQ9I7E2_Xvm4AvykXrw"}

Therefore, I end up there for groceries more often than not. \n\nThen came yesterday:\n\nI have been looking an issue of Time magazine.  I have tried a few places with no luck.  So rather than waste gas money, I began calling around.  I live about a mile from the Sentry store and thought I would give it a call on the way home.  The phone was answered and I simply asked: Do you carry Time Magazine?  Her response was: Maybe, yeah I think so.  Before I could ask if it was in stock, she hung up on me.  No good bye.  Nothing.  If she was busy she could have said that.  \n\nSo I go into the store to search for it, assuming it is there.  I do find it in the magazine rack and I check the head of the registers.  I hear a voice and immediately recognize the woman who answered the phone.  She had a peach colored fleece on.  She is an older woman in her 50/60's with graying hair behind the customer service register.  I pass her up because I am completely upset to see her doing nothing.  The fact that she hung up on me and I come to the store and I see her sitting on a chair doing nothing angered me.  \n\nI continued to look for my magazine.  One of the cashiers asks if they can help me with something.  I tell her I am looking for Time Magazine.  Her response: Well, umm, what?  Never heard of it.  \n\nNow, I could care less if they do not carry it, but thus far I have been told you might carry it by a woman who hung up on me and then a cashier who has never heard of a national magazine.  I keep looking.  I ask another cashier who might know.  After all, what if I just overlooked it?  She says she does not know.  And that is it.  \n\nThat is my whole experience trying to find a magazine.  I walked out feeling completely terrible.  I shop at the store because it is near my house.  Last night, I decided to stop shopping there.  I will drive to the belt line and go to Pick and Save or up to Sun Prairie.

You're cancelling my appointment and not even apologizing or offering me any option like a shorter service?\n\nI swallow my anger and return the call think that perhaps since they canceled my appointment, they would find a way to quickly accommodate me with a new appointment or perhaps upgrade me for the inconvenience.  Nope.  I was informed that Mallory's next time slot was a week and a half out or I could see someone else on a Tuesday - Who needs their makeup done for a Tuesday night?\n\nHonestly if it wasn't a gift certificate I would just cancel and go somewhere else. This is NOT a great first impression.\n\nTo be fair, I would like to add that their phone staff have always been delightful. So that and the limitations of yelp are the only reason they get a star.  I will update after I have my service, hopefully they are worth the inconvenience and irritation.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WfeA7PurZdBOPXcGB27vEA"}

They had some special parmesean herb fries that I asked to get instead of the regular ones because that sounded a bit more exciting. They were not exciting. More like they shook the jar of Kraft parm over the fries. The sandwich was alright. Not horrible, but nothing to write home about either and a tad bit dry.

The beer was outrageous, and we were teased a bit when we didn't order it. I ordered the shrimp and papaya. It tasted good, and I know this is Wisconsin, but there were about 7 shrimp on a HUGE bed of cabbage. The plantain appetizer was served AFTER our meal arrived and they were soggy and fairly gross. To be fair, the ribs and chicken was a more substantial meal and was well executed.\nThe worst part of the meal was the waitress. We were not greeted when we walked in although it was the middle of the dinner hour, which wasn't so bad, but it was a harbinger of how the rest of the meal went. After being werved, we didn't see the waitress again. During the meal, she never refilled our water glasses even tho that was the primary drink of my dinner mate.  After we were finished, I had to interrupt the waitress and the dishwasher who were watching TV, very loudly too, in order to get a to-go box. We were then chastised because the box was for my friend, not me, and she thought that he should've been the one to speak up. We shouldn't have had to speak up at all!!!\n\nSo, the final analysis is that they produce mostly good food, but it is WAY overpriced and the customer service sucks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qodyGnpmj1zEfi7nJ534BA"}

Everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive Friday night dinner.

Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken.  We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals.  Again, we waited.  Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup.  It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening.\n\nOur entrees arrived shortly after.  It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup.  Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl.  It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out.\n\nThe fries were cold on all our meals.  The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable.  More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours.  My husband laughed and told him, \"No, I already got this half full bowl.\"\n\nA few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger.  At that point I was disgusted - and done.  I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked.  When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.  So my husband's comment must have at least made it back to her, yet there was no apology for it, nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entr\u00e9e.\n\n$58.00 for 3 people, lackluster/slow service and terrible food?

It took a couple years because of the diversity and number of places on that street, but eventually he got to all of them. That sounded like a fun project to undertake, so I thought I'd do the same. Picking which street in Madison was kind of difficult, especially since you can stay driving on the same road and it'll change names like 4 or 5 times. I decided to pick one such road: Monona Dr which turns into Attwood Ave, which turns into Willy Street. There are so many great places on this road, some of which are already favorites, but others that I need to get around to visiting and reviewing. Now the journey begins....\n\nIt was a snowy December Sunday afternoon when I visited this Red Robin. The snow kept a lot of people away, but the place was still about a third filled. I was greeted and seated promptly. I've been to Red Robins before and I like to think of them as an easy place to go when my sister is in town visiting with her kids. Kids seem welcome here (they even can get a balloon) and since it's already a loud place, I don't mind when my niece and nephew act up (to say I'm not a kid person would be a great understatement). The burgers here are good with fun toppings. My go to is the A1 peppercorn burger which may rival Bob's Bad Breath Burger from the Weary Traveler when it comes to giving you bad breath afterwards. The onion bun along with the crispy onions on top definitely leaves you reaching for some gum after dinner. If you are feeling gluttonous, the never ending refills of steak fries can fill you up. When they are fresh and hot, they are pretty tasty, but if you are looking for crispy fries, this isn't the place for you. They had some boozy ice cream shakes on the menu that looked interesting, but I'm not in the mood for shakes in winter. Overall it's a decent place for burgers and fries if you don't mind that it's loud, there's tons of pop culture crap all over the walls, and that it's a chain.

They are similar to Culvers but doesn't offer you that \"home quality\" kind of experience. \n\nI typically get the Bleu Ribbon with some pink. I like the fried onion straws they add to the burger as well as this chipotle spread they use after toasting their buns. Mix that with the burger, BBQ sauce and bleu cheese and you've got a great tasting large juicy burger. I sometimes have to cut it in half because it's hard to take a bite out of. The burger comes with a side of endless steak fries they are often cooked to perfection. They are one of the few places that offers onion rings, however, as much as I love me some rings, I do not care much for theirs. The onions they use are extremely thick making it hard to bit into. I have often times ended up just eating the breading and putting the onions to the side. They are onion rings! This doesn't make any sense! They need to slice their onions thinner. As of now, I do not believe they are editable. \n\nMy other negative is presentation. The Bleu Ribbon has a lot going on so I realized that sometimes the burger can get messy. However, there have been times where my burger has come out looking like it went through a tornado. Lettuce falling everyone, too much BBW sauce, bleu cheese thrown on. The presentation needs to get better. I've experienced this at two different Red Robins. Also, I've also noticed that within the last year, they've cut back on the amount of steak fries they give you. Since they are bottomless it makes really no difference but I've definitely seen a change. \n\nThat being said, I would rate Red Robbi as being more than just an \"A-OK\" burger joint but they are far from a \"4+ star\" quality kind of joint. I do like the atmosphere. They have a few game machines, TV's, bar, background music and great classic pictures hanging on the walls that are great for helping to start a conversation ( say you're on a first date?). The art and photography they use to decorate the place I believe adds a lot of character and \"spunk\". \n\nThey do get very busy on weekends so expect a wait for a table and for your food but from my experience, it has never been extremely long. Wait staff has been good for me as well. \n\nOverall, they are a solid burger place. A bit pricey but I do think they are good. \n\nOh, one more thing, if you're dieting,....The Bleu Ribbon is 1,001 calories and fries are close to 500 calories!!! (According to my \"Lose it!\" app - they could be wrong but I also believe this is an extremely high calorie meal)", "type": "review", "business_id": "4pZeC9W0EIiBTOJMnwG2vw"}

Nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city. What takes places like this to another level is the service and the ambiance. This is what took Red Robin straight into the toilet.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, this place felt different. I've been here off and on for years, but there was a weird vibe in the air. I knew it was going to be a memorable visit after the hostess asked if we were \"going to need a high chair for that?\" while gesturing at our 9 month old daughter.\n\nWe were seated fairly quickly, which was nice, and our server seemed average, didn't tell us about anything new, didn't ask us if it was our first time at Red Robin (usually they do, and it wasn't, but still, try a little), and didn't bring us any silverware or napkins. Took our drink order, took our order, and left.\n\nShe knew we had a baby with us, and knew that she had just taken an order from the table of 8 behind us, and didn't bother to consider bringing the fruit cup for our daughter or my wife and I a basket of fries ahead of time since we'd be waiting a bit due to the large ticket in queue ahead of us. She didn't even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime. Just went all ghost and ignored us.\n\nIn this meantime, my wife and I are entertaining our daughter and looking and watching around us. She notices the manager checking in with other tables and rolling her eyes a bit after a few exchanges with customers. I notice a few scoffs and eye-rolls among the staff, and start to get bothered by how the staff is acting like this job is beneath them.\n\nAnother server brings us our food. I had asked for a side of sauce that doesn't show up, but she gets it promptly. I had asked for no tomato on the burger, but was talked over so she must not have heard it. No big deal.\n\nWe go to serve some fruit to our daughter, but we still don't have any silverware or napkins, so we ask and some are brought reasonably promptly. And set right in front of our 9 month old daughter. Not the brightest of plans to set metal forks and knives in front of any small child, but especially one who is currently fussing a bit at not having any food.\n\nAt no point does the manager come by to check on us. Our server barely says another word to us after handing us the bill. They coasted this entire time, why did I expect them to suddenly make any effort? Because I thought they would want us to come back.\n\nI'm of the belief that if you think your job is beneath you, then you should prove it. You never know who is watching or who you're serving, and who may be able to help you get out of the job that you don't really like. I mean, there are so many places to get a mediocre burger, you may as well offer above and beyond service to make it stand out.\n\nI guess when even the manager is rolling her eyes at customers, the rest of the staff begins to believe that kind of behavior is acceptable.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4pZeC9W0EIiBTOJMnwG2vw"}

In addition, they also host wine, cigar, and other tasting events that are well-attended.\n\nThe only thing I can't get over are the bizarre hours. They're open until 7pm Tuesday-Friday, 5pm on Saturdays, and closed Sundays and Mondays.\n\nFor me (and a huge number of my social circle,) cigars are a relaxing, social experience, not a rushed errand, like I'm picking up milk and eggs at the grocery. \n\nAs a small business owner myself, I respect another's need to set their hours as they see fit, but with the Tasting Room's business hours as they are, I'm rarely able to make it over there on weekdays, and lack of weekend evening hours nix that possibility as well.\n\nI'd like to give them at least four stars, but it doesn't matter if you have the best-stocked humidor in the Midwest if it's difficult to access it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6Y_Y3Nzzf9FsjyXtjIll7w"}

OK, I'm game.\n\nFirst, this is the Pinney branch - it doesn't say that in the header.\n\nWhat can I say? Public libraries are awesome and this one is no exception. There are thousands of books, plus magazines, video, audio and even tools (did you know you can check out tools?) all for free. There are plenty of places to sit, tables if you're trying to get work done, and computers for public use. There's also a big meeting room where they hold a nice variety of interesting events. There are several themed book displays around the library, which is nice when I wander in just looking for something, anything, to read. I think my favorite feature, though, is the hold service: you can request any item from any library in roughly half of the state, and it will be delivered to this library in short order. I know, it's a common library service these days, but have you ever stopped to think about how amazingly helpful it really is? And for free!\n\nMy only disappointment is that the circulation desk staff are pretty consistently unfriendly. Rarely rude, never incompetent, just very few smiles and no unnecessary words.

Decent sides, cheap drinks, decent service, but extremely tiny and easily packed - especially on Friday nights.\n\nDetailed review: the fish fry fanatics crew selected Toby's Supper Club as the target for our taste buds this week.  We were \"warned\" by a co-worker that it was a \"local/townie\" type place, but it didn't deter us.  We ventured out to Toby's, found a parking spot, and muscled our way into the place.\n\nI say \"muscled\" because the place was PACKED.  We arrived at around 7:30pm that evening; we didn't get seated at a table until nearly 10:00pm... It was ridiculously full.  And hot.  Too many people and not enough A/C, for sure!\n\nDespite the packed-to-the-gills nature, we were quickly served by the bartenders.  Talk about \"machines\" - the two folks that were tending the bar were going non-stop, multi-tasking, and never missing a beat.  May not have been the friendliest service, but they were literally giving change while mixing a drink and taking at least 2 additional orders... all at once.  Free pretzels were a nice touch as well.\n\nOh, and did I mention the drinks were cheap?!  Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour: $3.  Beers - dunno, but we drank for 3 hours on $30.  That's good by my book.\n\nThe ordering process is interesting... you'll be sitting/standing at the bar, and out of nowhere will appear a waitress.  She'll take your order and will then grab you when your food and table are both ready.  We ordered: Baby Pike, Cod, and Lake Perch with a side of cheesy hashbrowns.\n\nAs mentioned, the wait was incredibly long - at least 2.5 hours.  But it was worth it.  Our table became available, we were seated, and we enjoyed a pre-dinner salad (nothing fancy, but fresh and tasty), and the customary carrots/celery/radish/green onion bowl of veggies.\n\nThe fish arrived, and wow.  Wow - that's about all I can say.  So wonderful.  Lightly breaded, fried to perfection, and not a single hint of grease.  Served piping hot, to boot.  What we all liked about the fish was the fact that the fish was actually the star - the breading wasn't overdone and it didn't steal any of the thunder from the fish.  \n\nThe hashbrowns were huge and perfectly cooked - dark/crispy brown crust with a perfectly melted cheese blend on top.  Just a hint of grease, but we're picking nits here...\n\nThe bill arrived - $44 for the three of us, including another round of drinks.  Our server, Rhonda, was absolutely stellar as well - she took fantastic care of us, and it turns out that her son and his girlfriend were the bartenders.\n\nSummary: Toby's Supper Club = WIN\n\nFood: 4.5 - 4.75 stars\nService: 4.5 stars\nValue: 4.5 stars\nAtmosphere: 4.5 stars (classic supper club: paneling, dark wood)\nMisc: Dinged slightly for the long wait and sauna-like heat\n\nSummary: It's worth the wait to get fish here on Friday nights.  Just dress comfortably, bring some cash for the bar, and be prepared to wait.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FIR1SRvSAMNTO3VvNaJn2g"}

You enter and sit at the bar. You order at the bar, and the server comes to get you when your food is ready, and then you are seated.\n\nThe bartenders make a great Old-fashioned, one of the best in the city. \n\nAt your table, you'll find an array of decent goods typical of a supper club: a basket of de-frozen rolls; a plate of celery, carrots, and scallions; again, de-frozen cinnamon rolls for dessert; and breadsticks and butter.\n\nThe best dish on the menu, one that I can't order, is fried chicken. They make it to order. Because of this, it can hold up the meal, which the server will generally alert you about. My friend loves the fried colossal shrimp, which is awesome and also $$$. I generally get the cod, which is good. I doubt any of the fish is fresh, but perhaps on the weekends, it is. \n\nAll meals come with a salad. Get the blue cheese dressing. You can also add blue cheese crumbles. \n\nIf you love fantastic service and Wisconsin kitsch, this is a great joint. Don't expect five-star food, despite the five-star reviews.

I had ordered the grilled pesto garlic shrimp which was the special that night and it was very good. On their menu they say they are known for their hash browns. I have to ask myself why?? Nothing special at all. My husband had the New York Strip which he said was just OK. Nothing he would rush back again to order. He also had the hash browns and was not impressed.

He said it was very obvious he was not suited for kennels. \n\nUnfortunately, he also told me that some kennels are known for taking dogs that don't do well and lying to the owners to keep the business. When I mentioned Hickory Hills, he laughed and said they were the worst kennel in Madison. He also told me a story about how the owner or manager killed several dogs by leaving insect poison out in the play area.\n\nI feel so lucky my dog wasn't more hurt at this horrible kennel, and I hope nobody else has to lose a beloved pet to this sub-par facility.

We actually went a few days before seeing anyone else on our schedule. We felt like we owned the place. \n\nThe lobby became our living room, with a nice fireplace and overstuffed chairs. The breakfast room was perfect for gathering with friends who also came in for a few nights. The pool was the highlight for our local grandaughter who came to visit.\n\nWe stayed in a one-bedroom suite. I also checked out the two-bedroom and one-room suites. The rooms were all decent size and very comfortable. Kitchenettes featured a full-sized refrigerator, cooktop, dishwasher and microwave.\n\nRooms include a complimentary breakfast with a wide range of choices including hot waffles.\n\nThe location is outstanding, with easy access to the freeway. It was 10 minutes to the airport, 15 minutes to downtown. There are lots of really good restaurant choices at nearby East Towne, and a fabulous sports bar (Pooleys) just a block away.\n\nThanks to the management for a great stay. We would absolutely make this our permanent stop in Madison next time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MBLOaMM3g4TrLNpHUA5EtQ"}

The kitchenette was well stocked (utensils, plates, microwave, paper towels, full-sized fridge), which we appreciated since it meant less stuff that we had to lug around with our baby stuff.  \n\nThe swimming pool and hot tub were small but fine, and we enjoyed the outdoor area where they have a half basketball court and picnic tables.  We brought a picnic blanket and were able to enjoy dessert outside with our son in the beautiful weather, a nice and unique amenity.\n\nThe hotel offers complementary \"hot\" breakfasts, and for those who are as curious as we were about what that means - biscuits and gravy, eggs, sausage, waffle maker, French toast (depending on the day) along with cereal, bagels, muffins, yogurt, fruit, juice and coffee.  There is no room service, but there is a vending area with food and toiletries in case you're really hard up.  \n\nThere isn't much around Grandstay (we tried to get to Great Dane East restaurant, which is listed on Yelp as 0.5 miles from the hotel but that must be a mistake because it was more like 5 miles based on our GPS), but there is an Uno's nearby, but it took about 20 minutes to get to downtown Madison from the hotel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MBLOaMM3g4TrLNpHUA5EtQ"}

But this time it created a problem.  \n\nWe got our tickets and were happily standing at the concession counter ordering tons of overpriced, bad for you, food when this teeny, tiny, little teenage employee approached me and advises me that they are going to have to search my back pack.  WTF??\n\nThey got a homeless guy out front smokin' a doobie with some teenagers, but they want to search my stuff?!?!  But you see I was wrong about what they were looking for.  \n\nKnowing that I had nothing in my pack that was without prescription, (ho ho hee hee) I willingly handed it over to the mickey mouse club house member.  She opens the first big zipper and finds, OH MY GAWD!!  \n\nRICE CAKES!!!  \n\nI am so busted.  That's right she was lookin' for food contraband, not drugs!  The first thing she says is, \"yep, food\" and she hands the pack back to me looking disgusted.  She then advises me that I have to leave the pack locked in the office during the movie we came to see.\n\nBecause you know, even though we're standing there with food from the concession stand, we still might wanna eat them rice cakes instead!!!!  \n\nAt this point everyone is looking, and my fellow movie companion is standing there eating his newly purchased popcorn enjoying the live action theater.  I thought I wouldn't care if she wanted to hold on to it while I watch a movie, but my credit cards, cell phone, iPod and prescription drugs were the real items of value and that had me worried.  \n\nThankfully for me all the contents of my pack were still there when I got it back from food police.  However the movie sucked, I sat there the whole time wondering if her and her teenage friends were rifling through my pack.\n\nAll this because of rice cakes my friends.  So the next time you dare purchase some, just remember it's better to use them as target practice than to mistakenly bring them into the theater!!!\n\nEven though bringing in outside food was not my intention this time, I can say that next time I go, I think I'll wear a trench coat and inside I'll have bags of popcorn and cans of soda strapped to me so I can smuggle in the contraband and be an arsehole just for the heck of it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pACm1yLb9Pwc1mOuvC3UDw"}

After being in Milwaukee and having iPic, which have big cushy chairs, and with tables for armrests, the $11 matinee for luxury seating AND popcorn at iPic isn't a bad price.\n\nIf all you need is a theater, than this will suit you just fine.\n\nFYI, If you park on the side of the theater you are likely to see young people in love fully engaging themselves in vehicle shenanigans. If you're there with your family and you're not quite ready to have *that* talk, I suggest you don't park on the right side of the theater.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pACm1yLb9Pwc1mOuvC3UDw"}

I checked the website last night at 8pm and realized I missed the 7:25pm showing of 12 Years a Slave.  So I decided to go tonight.  \n\nI got there to purchase my tickets when the window person told me there is no such showtime.  I was like, what?  Huh?  No.  \n\nShe told us to head out and the times were on the wall.  Well they sure were, and in an obvious place, the numbers 7:25 were removed. The gap was comical.  \n\nWe were told by the manager that updates can be made and will be reflected on the website 15 minutes after they are made.  This means that the showtimes are simply suggested times, they will not actually be honored and can change at any time to put up a more popular film.  In addition to that, it was my responsibility to check the internet before I left home.  His assumption that I have constant and immediate access to the internet was insulting.  \n\nI was not the only one standing there.  Another patron complimented me on the points I made to Tom, the manager.  They are all valid points and completely unacceptable that an email is sent out each week reflecting these times.  Each theater sends out their showtimes.  In addition, I checked this time yesterday.  \n\nThe box office person did not even realize that a time was cancelled.  Inform your people to address the problem in a productive manner.  Perhaps: I apologize, there was a change to the schedule or I am sorry for the error, can I suggest another movie.\n\nThe movie was to show at 7:25.  Unless you got there 30 minutes early, you only had one other movie option.  Everything else started during the 6 o'clock hour.  It was offensive to be suggested that I see some other movie.  \n\nI am not always in the mood for an action movie or a cartoon.  I find it tragic that an award-winning movie is not being shown during prime hours.  There were so many of us dumb-founded that there were no other options.  Tonight, they lost at least ten patrons (that I could see).\n\nTwo stars is: Meh, I've experience better and I would say that is what Eastgate Cinemas has become.  They do not have enough showtimes for movies which lack blockbuster status.  Then to cancel showtimes with no notice is not a great way to do business.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pACm1yLb9Pwc1mOuvC3UDw"}

I found myself at Abra after a fender-bender left my bumper with a deep, ugly scrape.  This is how it went down. I was sitting in my parked car in a parking ramp at UW-Madison.  I vaguely noticed a car pulling in too close in the space next to me--but I was too busy talking to my BF on the phone to pay much attention.  All of a sudden, my car rocked to the side as the parking-impaired perp hit me, and then gunned his car backward, forcibly dragging it out of the space and doing a lovely number on my bumper.  I whipped around to look just in time to see the guy taking off at full speed. \n\nWell...that got my Irish up.  \n\nI am NOT making this up...there were witnesses.  Being familiar with the parking ramp, I was fairly sure that he wouldn't be able to make a clean get-away.  So I jumped out of my car and chased him down on foot--in high heels.  When I caught up to him, it was a terrified teenage guy (can you imagine the sight of a crazy, high-heeled woman approaching at a dead run in the review mirror???).  In short: I convinced him that he should return to the scene of the crime.  I have a broken toe for my trouble--and a laugh every time I think about it.\n\n'Nuff said.  So anyway.  Abra.  I arrived on-time for my appointment, and watched in growing dismay as one, then two people arrived after me and were immediately helped by one of the technicians.  Then I realized that the harassed soul casting helpless glances in my direction as he dealt with an annoying, disgruntled customer was the technician appointed to deal with my assessment.  Stuff happens.  The actual assessment took only about 10 minutes, and then I was on my merry way.  It just seems like there should be a first-come, first-served type of system in place, but what do I know?", "type": "review", "business_id": "-J-kQpDGIkX_1XHfi0HG2g"}

So I took it there for an assessment.\n\nEveryone was extremely kind and helpful. The process of getting the estimate both by Geico and by ABRA was very quick and easy. Also, ABRA was nice enough to provide me with a rental car on their dime. Enterprise came out to ABRA's location and we took care of the rental there.

The venting was indeed up to code and that there should be no real reason that I couldn't have the A/C and venting work I wanted done with the current set-up. The inspector then also told me he has had trouble with All Comfort Services in the past using similar bait-and-switch tactics to upsell customers into equipment that is not needed (in my case it was to make up for the A/C unit I was getting for much less than the list price I think). \n\nEmails and phone calls to Kendall Richards, the owner, went unanswered when I tried in vain to get my money refunded to me.

Now, I am an average consumer with a college education, however, I am not familiar with HVAC systems at all. So, I am posting this in the public to hopefully help other consumers to not fall for the \"Spring Tune Up\" Offer by All Comfort Services @ 5245 Voges Road Madison, WI 53718. \n\nIn full transparency I am also posting copies of the quotes & receipts from the technician. Here: https://plus.google.com/u/0/111026625881803880071/posts/PKBhrxTNQs7 \n\nScenario: \n- I found a special on Angieslist for $139 for a technician to come to my house for a spring AC Tune Up. \n- My system is 23 years old, and the furnace has been very well maintained works fine. \n- The technician was at my house for 45 minutes. \n\n1. Replaced my furnace filter. \n2. Put \"Comfort Services\" stickers all over my furnace (and removed the competitors) \n3. I showed him how to turn on my thermostat (I have a nest) \n4. Hooked up the gauges to the AC and ran the system 6. Stated that I have a very small amount of freon, and that it is cost prohibitive to find a leak ($435-$600, and recharge $161). \n5. Recommended that I buy a new AC unit and furnace \n6. Charged me $139. \n7. Scheduled a Salesman to come to my house 2 business days later to sell me a new A/C & Furnace system for between $7,679 - $8,742. \n\n\nSince then, I have had 2 other HVAC companies visit me and make other recommendations and provide a complimentary \"leak check\" by loading in nitrogen and offering me some other options. \n\n\nConclusion: I've decided to recharge the freon in my system through another HVAC company and they will come out in 2 months (free of charge) to test my pressure again.

We did not know who to call, but saw our furnace was installed by All Comfort so we gave them a call. They said the service visit would be around $96.00 and we thought that amount was fairly standard. The tech was there about 2 hours after we called. He then spent about 90 minutes diagnosing the issue, which was a faulty high limit switch. He then told us he could not have it fixed until Wednesday and that the cost would be $600.00! This was after charging us $375.00 to just come and diagnose. Obviously my husband and I were in a panic because that is a lot of money, but to have to wait until Wednesday to get your furnace fixed when the temps are below zero is frightening. To make a long story a little shorter, we called another company in town and they told us they could come on Saturday and fix the problem for $200. We were happily back in our home by Saturday afternoon. I will say that my husband received a call from the President of All Comfort who was very apologetic and who graciously waived the $375.00 fee. I guess there was a mixup in the pricing by the tech. So to sum it up, great customer service from the president, but strange pricing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zjvhOPocFPsImtJMWV55WA"}

I guess I could have scrapped these last few, but that's not what Yelpers do.  Is it!?\n\nThis was your typical Courtyard by Marriot.  Clean, well-run, friendly staff.  They have a good-sized pool and a big, comfortable lobby.  There were quite a few people checking in at the same time I was (the young lady at the front desk seemed a bit frazzled, but still very professional) and I was surprised how much room there was given the limited space they had cordoned off for registration.\n\nI would complain about the fact that there were only two elevators at either end of the hotel, but for this size hotel it didn't make sense to add more.  It gave the feeling that we were waiting a long time because we had only one option, but that was probably just skewed because of my impatience of wanting to get to where I was going that night.  I did take the stairs a few times when I didn't want to wait and going up and down to the third floor was surprisingly un-strenuous.  They had enough room that the staircase was very shallow.  Actually, a very unusual setup.\n\nI was a little disappointed in the morning when we were trying to get breakfast.  Like the first Marriot we stayed on the outbound part of our trip, there were waffle makers, but these weren't self-serve.  There was an area for a \"chef\" to make you eggs/omelette, but there was no one manning the station.  Granted, it was early.  But still.  If you're going to have a station like that, shouldn't there be *someone* there?\n\nEven with that, we had a nice stay.

Its hard to enquire about a dog when no one or information is available regarding the dog.

Perhaps they should consider arranging discounted fees with vet services they use.  I understand it does cost a great deal of money to home an animal which should be taken into consideration by the adoptee however you shouldnt have to spend hundreds to get a dog.

Help is readily available, and there is a wealth of information about each dog attached to their kennel, and you can get their whole health folder upon request. \n\nAdditionally, the adoption fees are almost always $175, though they are $250 for a puppy or $275-350 for a \"highly desirable\" breed (which I think they rarely label dogs as that - all of the dogs we encountered, including purebreds, were the standard $175). Considering that all of their dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, updated on most vaccinations, and given vet exams, I don't think that their rates are unreasonable. In fact, they were lower than two other local shelters not related to the Humane Society.\n\nI have often heard how they do put so many dogs to sleep here, and it does upset me a great deal.

While they don't blow me away with the quality or value of their services, they are a step above other full service car washes in the area.  I also appreciate the fact I get a consistent wash from visit to visit. And if you go when things are not crazy busy, they do spend a little extra time on you vehicle.\n\nThings I like:\n * They provide a thorough cleaning, inside and out.  Unlike visits to gas station car washes, I rarely find unwashed spots on my vehicle after a visit to gas station car wash. \n * To me, the interior cleaning is worth the extra $3 over what  you would pay at the local gas station car wash.  Even after an extended road trip with the kiddo, the interior of the vehicle looks pretty good.\n\nThings I don't:\n * Enough with the freakin' upsell sales pitch.  It never works and turns people off.  Don't waste our time.\n * The fragrance choices are just gawd awful.  [WARNING: rant to commence in 3...2...1]  I'd rather smell a sack of rotting potatoes in the trunk (and trust me, that's bad) than torture my nostrils with the synthetic crap fragrances you guys use.

Major props for that. 2 - They understood me... considering I don't remember ordering the pizza (I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad, and me saying \"who ordered pizza\" then I burped... wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo. 3 - apparently, after checking my voice mail, the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes (we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band, in case you don't know, were pretty awesome. Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gent's; Kansas City Bullriders). Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times. I'm assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out. Maybe he had a slice with us? Who really knows these things. However, I do know that I was insanely impressed with D'moes... from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember. It was pretty darn good.

Not to say I'm a broke hobo, but seriously, the difference in cost is a draft beer at a classy joint and 2 at the places I frequent.  My biggest irk with Domino's is that they advertise $11.99 Any Speciality Pizza and if you change 1 item, say you don't like mushrooms (not saying that's me, could be, not saying) and trade for something like black olives (even trade, no?  Sometimes I even end up with less on the pizza because I don't like meats all that much and substitute veggies).  So if you change 1 item instead of their $11.99 advertised special, all of a sudden the price is $16.99?  $5 for some f''in black olives?  Seriously.  I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!  About the 3rd time this happened I finally put my foot down and looked up Papa John's website.  $11 any pizza, up to 7 toppings, any toppings.  Pretty much my BFF.\n\nPJ's.

I didn't have much of a problem with drinks, or service until later that night... and that's why I'm taking the time to give this place a 1-star review.\n\nThis is a review about a certain bartender, whose name my friend and I never got, but he said he was Chinese and Colombian. \n\nThe area seems to close down early.... even though there seemed to be a basketball game getting out. The bartender said he was closing up early, directed us to another bar (closed when we got there) hand we found a place nearby. Shortly after, the same bartender showed up at the bar, started drinking with us. I don't remember much about the conversation, except for some lies this guy was telling us, saying that he was running the bar after two weeks of working there, that he didn't live in Phoenix, he lived in New York - later, he forgot that he said that, and told us he lived in the same city in California that we did. \nBy the time the bar closed, I was getting pretty sloshed, and he proceeded to invite himself to our motel room (I thought my friend invited him, and my friend thought I did), and by the time we got to my friend's car, he insisted I sit in the back seat. \nI'll skip some details here, and make a long story short:\n\nI puked on the ride home, so I spent the rest of the night sobering up. The Chinese/Colombian guy kept pushing weed and beer on my friend (who's a lesbian, by the way) and when you're a man, you can tell when a guy is being a sleazeball and trying to get into a girl's pants. It became blatantly obvious that he was waiting for me to pass out so he could do what he wanted, and so I forced myself to stay awake. Again, I'm skipping on a lot of detail here, because Yelp really isn't the place for that.\nAfter he had long overstayed his welcome (which was never offered in the first place), my friend went to the bathroom, and I mustered all the civility I had left to ask him to leave as nicely and non-offensively as possible. To this, he insisted that unless I reimbursed him for the pot and beer he brought (neither of which I personally imbibed) he didn't have to leave. I bit my tongue.\nShortly after, I could hear him talking about me outside when he and my friend were having a cigarette. I snapped, had to get rude with him, pulled my friend inside and slammed the door in his face. \n\nThe point of this whole review is this:\nLadies, watch out for this sleazeball bartender. He'll try to get into your pants by the most disrespectable means.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EmzaQR5hQlF0WIl24NxAZA"}

It is connected to Club Downtown which has two other floors that play latin pop/rock/hip hop and reggaeton. The cover is $10. They are open til at least 3 am (and the other floors stay open even later I think) so that is an advantage over the clubs that close at 2pm. To get to the Palazzo floor, you go in through Club Downtown's main entrance and then go out on the front patio and then back in to Palazzo's dance floor. Ask if you get lost and the security or bartenders will point you there. I like the size of the floor, which is tile. It is not as hot and crowded as other salsa places like Pepins on Saturday. Drinks vary from great to weak (mainly the mixed drinks) depending on the bartender, they do have specials sometimes. As a long time salsa dancer who goes with friends (male and female) but no set partner for the night, it can be hard to find a good salsa dancer here if  you don't already know one. So salseros/salsaholics if you will be going without a partner you might want to try to find at least one good dancer to go with you so you will have fun.  Or if you look on www.azsalsa.net or www.meetup.com (check for Scottsdale or Phoenix salsa groups) there are plenty of socials and lessons where you can meet others if you are new and want to meet other dancers or go out with a group. The music is good but since I go a lot,  I start to hear the same songs over and over. I think they should bring in different djs, rotate them or make sure the music gets mixed up to keep people coming back.  Also note there is a strict dress code - it is posted outside. I know several guys who had to go back home to change cause they couldn't get in. I don't remember all the specifics but I believe some things to note are no hats/sunglasses, tennis shoes, tee shirts, baggy pants, bandanas, etc. I'd say collared shirt (tucked in), nice slacks/pants and shoes and you'd be okay. They do have metal detectors going in. However, I have rarely seen any fights and I feel safe here.

I wish they would drop the cover charge down or at least offer some drink specials! \n\nThe bar has its own set of problems: I just hate spending $40 on drinks and not even getting a buzz out of it. It's hard enough to tell the bartender what you want over the music, but it's even harder when everything you ask for they don't have (or maybe they think they don't have it because they can't hear me?) Mind you I'm not picky or difficult, I just expect the bartender to know how to make the drink I want or at least stock  2 of the 3 beers I'm asking for.\n\nSolution for the Yelper: If you can, drink before you go.\n\nSeating: Maybe, just maybe, invest in another velvetine sectional or two. Club Pallazzo certainly charges enough for cover to afford a new couch. I like to rest my pretty feet after I'm done dancing and people watch, and maybe I don't feel like going on the patio.\n\nThe Ambiance: The inside is gorgeous. It's definitly the atmosphere that brings all the boot-stomping night owls out en masse. The frescoes on the walls and ceiling sport scantily clad vampiresses looking for a bite, and the velvet curtains that hang from the ceiling to the floor, along with the throne chairs give the club it's regal aire.\n\nThe Music: It's true, they have different DJ's switch off sets. The DJ I like also DJ's at Le Homme on Wed. nights. If I don't like what's playing I head outside for fresh air on the ample patio. But overall the music is good. \n\nI know some people that go every weekend. If I did that, I would be living in the alleyway behind Tranz.

One of them being the well-loved Phoenix band Snake! Snake! Snakes! Drummer David Cooper was physically assaulted by the venue manager Caesar Rodriguez* when he walked into the managers office and asked to borrow a rug that he needed to put under his drum kit. Rodriguez told him no, and said he didn't give a f$#k. Cooper then asked why they had bands play here if they didn't give a f$#k. To which the venue manager responded by dragging Cooper out of his office by his collar, put him in a choke hold, and drug him down the stairs in front of at least 100 witnesses. If you haven't seen Snake! Snake! Snakes!  -- this is a very kind, peaceful, fun indie band, and great people as well. Professionally they are always a pleasure to work with, and they don't even remotely appear menacing. To make this story even more odd - David was having a professional conversation with this same manager just an hour before the altercation. I saw David being drug down the steps, and then I hung out with him for the next couple of hours while waiting for the Phoenix Police.\n\nPS - the sound system was absolutely atrocious, when I told the sound guy there was a problem with the bass amp cutting in and out, it he told me that it was the bands equipment, and it clearly wasn't. The problems started with the first band, and continued through the second band. All of the amps were cutting in and out, there cracks, pops and echos, it appeared to be some sort of electrical current problem.\n\n*The source of this name came from the head of security at the venue", "type": "review", "business_id": "SiwN7f0N4bs4ZtPc4yPgiA"}

First, the good:  This place is sooo clean, the guys are all awesome, polite, knowledgeable and you just get a great sense of being in a respectable place.   \n\nThe bad: One the way out the door, the mechanic that checked me in mentioned that it would be \"Fifty bucks to check out the car, and we'll call you with a quote.\"\n\nThe quote came in for almost $900, which was far more than I was able to pay.   When I got back to the shop to pick it up, I was charged $61.34. I questioned the difference between what I was told and what they charged me, and apparently it was $55 for the inspection, plus shop rags, plus tax.  I guess I should have seen this coming?   I have never been charged to look at the car.  And certainly not $62 for a ten minute inspection. \n\nI was in the market for a new mechanic, but this is NOT the one that I will be going with.  They were somewhat surprised that I would fuss at all about the $12 difference.  As if I should have expected a 30% markup from what they told me.  Not a great way to build a relationship.  If they had told me before they took my keys and information about the cost of the inspection, quite honestly, I would have taken my car somewhere else.\n\nBottom line:  I think that if you know you are going to get work done, these guys look really top notch. But be prepared to pay for it.\n\nUPDATE:   I just finished repairing the car myself, and what these guys wanted to charge me $900 for, I was able to do myself for $140.  And that included buying a $20 set of drum brake tools, and a $25 Chilton's manual.  They told me that it would $130 JUST to bleed the brakes, which I did in about ten minutes with nothing but a pair of channel locks.

One, or two, at the most.\n\nNaturally, when I called them and sounded like I actually knew what I was talking about, they knocked $150 off the price they offered my wife.  Still not good enough.  It was $300 cheaper to tow our car all the way to our trusted Mesa mechanic and have him do the work.\n\nOh, and the inspection we used a Groupon for?

The battery, which I had purchased less than a month prior, decided it didn't want to work.  We suspected it was a bad connection to the terminal but couldn't be sure. Instead of driving to Checker Auto, I decided to take the car a couple blocks away to Virginia Auto.  I have a few friends who regularly take their vehicles here for service, so even though I had never utilized their serviced, I felt confident about taking my car in.\n\nAt 8am, their small lot was already packed, and I snagged the only available spot.  We walked in and were helped right away.  The very nice lady at the desk asked if I'd made an appointment ahead of time and I explained our situation.  She said they had quite a few other cars in with appointments but she would see what she could do.  We sat inside the small lobby and chatted for a while before she came back in.  My brand new battery was dead.  It had been completely drained!  She said they could put the battery back in and we could go back to Checker to have it replaced or they could install a new battery for me.  Not wanting to take a chance on another bad battery, I decided to have them take care of it for me.  Not more than 20 minutes later, they had finished!  I wasn't thrilled about having to pay more than I wanted to, but it was worth every penny.  After we got to Texas that afternoon, my very car-savvy Dad looked at the  car and said the battery had been installed very well - it was in securely and everything had been cleaned up really well.\n\nI need some serious maintenance done on the car, and I will absolutely be taking it in to Virginia Auto.

Of hearing about it, finally, we decided to walk over and pick up some food.\nthen I read some of the yelp reviews and almost changed my mind. The reviews were pretty bad: several reports of poor service and the -the most alarmingly one of all - pointing out how bland and flavorless the food was. also, there were descriptions of it being a cool baby type place with haughty staff and incompetent servers. Did the tempe pita jungle servers moonlight at wild thaiger?\nI was surprised because all the times I drove past it - before realizing how popular it was - I thought it looked typical of a thai/asian place. The name was silly and cheesy, and the giant purple banner that takes up almost the entire front of the unsuspecting cinderblock rest. has just the eyes of a tiger staring at you from their very purple perch. How can this place possibly be too-cool?\nI checked out their web site (which I was surprised to find they had one as this place looks pretty hole-in-the-wall) so we could order ahead and walk to pick it up. the site was pretty slow and I almost gave up, but I was pretty stoked on the options and the prices. Grilled peanut chicken? Sounds great. Spicy chicken curry, I'll take it. tiger prawn salad, ok. All for about $8?? Sounds pretty reasonable. I went with the curry chicken and the spring roll (all lunch items come with either soup of the day or the roll - unless your taking out, as they won't/can't do soup to go.)\nOff we went and when we walked up I was surprised to find that the ramada-like, large patio with high walls and iron bars took up the entire front of the building. We had to search around for the hidden entrance. Once inside it was busy with a downtown business casual crowd, but a scurrying waitress still held the door and asked if we wanted a table (for the record she was not in skinny jeans, flats and sporting tons of eyeliner and a fauxhawk, as I figured she would be).  We walked up to the bar to collect our food and pay, and the lively atmosphere made me sad we were going back to the office and not eating there. the bar area had a flat screen tv, there was lively if a little over-the-top Asian pop music, and the healthy crowd was a nice change of pace. Alas, we were in and out (they were not even put out by our asking to split up the to go order so we could each pay separately, even though they were obviously busy) in under 10 minutes.\nThe food stayed pretty hot for the 15 minute walk back, and they double bagged each Styrofoam box -thank god, as half my curry sauce came out of the box. It smelled great and the veggies looked good, but I braced myself for disappointment. Perhaps because I was expecting it to be bad, I was pleasantly surprised. It was pretty good. Mine was just enough spicy as is (for me, though and I'm a wuss - so If you're into hot-hot-hot, ask to punch it up a notch or three) and the serving was plenty for the price. The veggie spring roll was great - not even soggy from the trip, how did that happen? I think the curry sauce was a little thin, but it wouldn't keep me from ordering it again - my coworker's ginger chicken sauce looked thin as well, but she said it was still great. The tiger prawn salad had green, fresh lettuce (looked like a spring mix) and came with lots of scrimps that were \"fat and juicy.\" However, they listed that the salad came with crispy wontons, but her box was sans any wontons - really the only foil in the entire experience.\nAll in all I would say it was a score. The three of us agreed that it would make a good HH spot.\nIt's no yupha's, but certainly better than thai basil - and not a chain. Plus they were still busy, busy despite being smack in the middle of the light rail cluster fuch on central - they must be doing something right!", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

The soup we had was also very flavorful and best of all, the chicken in it was actual pieces of chicken breast (often, the chicken in soup is small pieces of dark meat). The Mussaman curry was also a lot better than most places we have had it - often, restaurants use pieces of flank or strip steak, but a more authentic version, like the one we had here, has more stew-like cuts of almost-braised beef. Also a real winner were the spicy clear/glass noodles with vegetables and chicken.

Now that the rail is almost up and running and getting to Wild Thaiger isn't such a chore, I went with a group of 6 to try this place out.\n\nWhen you walk in you immediately notice how dark it is as the lighting given off by candles and the kitchen in the back.  I've been to plenty of restaurants that do this to set the mood of the place so I don't mind candlelight.  However, this place was almost pitch black at times to where I couldn't see my dish so they could improve on the lighting a little bit.  The booths are small and set up very nice if you're just out on a date with your special someone.\n\nThe menu selection isn't vast but has all the usual suspects (curries, noodles, tofu dishes, etc.).  I had the chicken and potato dish with yellow curry with some cucumber and pepper veggies on the side.  While the presentation was very nice, the dish itself was just okay.  Almost everyone in the group I was with also had a currie dish and agreed the presentation was more impressive than the taste itself.  The one gal who got a noodle dish however said hers was terrific.\n\nMost of us got dessert to finish things off.  I got a slice of the mango cheesecake (very tasty).  Another person got the lemon ginger cheesecake and was very happy.  Everyone else got slices of the chocolate cake (which were HUGE by the way).\n\nThey also have drink specials on Monday and Wednesdays.  We went on Wednesday for $4 wine glass night.  I was gung ho to try a sip of the red Thai wine, but strangely the waiter strongly recommended against it.  I has a Shiraz instead which was fine.  Most everyone else got a white wine.\n\nOverall, the service was a little bit slow (especially getting us our check), but it was adequate.  The waiter was knowledgable about the nuances of each dish (which was good because two people in our group never had Thai food before).  Amazingly, when we originally sat down, the restaurant was just about dead.  But after 8:30pm the place was packed!  Not sure if this is normal, but seems like alot of the folks who live in and around the downtown area needed a late Thai fix.\n\nBottomline, good, but I've had better.  I commend Wild Thaiger and their people for surviving the onslaught of light rail construction that no doubt crippled their business.

It was a 30 minute drive from Laveen, as all are the Thai places in the area.  I ordered two of my staples (Tom ka Gai soup and Green Curry) and tried a new dish (for me), Holy Basil.  I got everything takeout.\n\nI'll start with the Holy Basil.  It was very good.  A nice balance of Thai flavors, and I thought it was quite similar to an Ayam Basil dish I used to get at a Malaysian place in Mt. View, CA.  My only complaint was that the chicken was big, thick chunks, like a fajita-style.  I expect delicate, tender meats at a high end Thai place.\n\nI opened my green curry and said: \"WHERE'S THE SAUCE\"?  I am VERY upset at the lack of sauce.  There was so little I can't comment on the flavor of the curry.  And, they had 2 different types of green beans in there:  chinese long beans, and American green beans.  The larger Amercian green beans weren't cooked.  That sucked.  The beef was tender enough but the peices were too big.  The one redeeming part of this dish was the fact that they had eggplant in it.  There is something about eggplant in green curry....\n\nThe Tom Ka Gai soup was  fantastic.  My only complaint would be the chicken, which again, was large fajita-style slices.   Doesn't make sense to me.\n\nWhile I was waiting at the bar for my order, I remember looking into the kitchen and wondering how they could possibly prepare everything on the menu in that tiny space.  Now, I think I know:  I suspect they prep all of their meats ahead of time and use the same size/shape/cuts for each dish to save time.  This results in a fajita-style cut of chicken that leaves me less than thrilled.\n\nOverall, the menu is brief and the food is good, but I don't think it's worth a long drive.  I don't expect to return when I could make the same drive to get to Swadee, which was just fabulous.  I gave this place a 3/5 because the Tom Ka Gai soup and Holy Basil were VERY good.  I am however disappointed in the green curry, the  cuts of meat, and by the way they completely ignored my request for Thai spicy; everything was rather mild in my opinion.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

And sure enough, we arrive and wait in the tiny entry way for at least 10 min before being approached by anyone. In that time, a friend who had arrived early and staked out at the bar informed me that as soon as she sat down, she was told that she couldn't order food because the kitchen was temporarily shut down because they were too busy. At the time we arrived it was maybe 30 percent full, and she assured me that that had happened 30-40 minutes ago, so they should be back on track by now. \nThe host finally showed up and said she could seat us, but it would be a while before the server would take our order bc they were \"recovering.\" Well, that's better than 10 people blocking an entryway, so I'm not sure why she seemed hesitant to seat us, even if we had to wait for a server. She assured us that we could order drinks from our table until the kitchen was \"ready.\"\nIt was only downhill from there. Thankfully, we were a jovial bunch - under any other circumstances this experience would have been disastrous. 15 min to get drink orders, another 15 to get the drinks. Another 20 min later he took our food orders. 30 min later they started coming out, sort of. Seven entrees came out, staggered over a period of five minutes. But three entrees - all pad thai - didn't arrive until at least 10 min later, when everyone else was finished. I understand not everyone can get food at exactly the same time with a party of 10, but they didn't even come close, and at the time we made our food orders it was at least an hour if not more after their alleged huge rush that shut down the kitchen. \nI got the peanut chicken - grilled chicken with peanut sauce, rice and grilled veggies. The sauce was too citrus-y for a peanut sauce and too thick (funny that I complained in my first review that my curry was too thin). Chicken underneath was completely flavorless and was dry and veggies were scant. Good thing it was only $10. Didn't get details from anyone else except the BF, who got the Kao Pad Jay, and kept saying over \"I'm so glad I got this!\"\nAll these issues seemed to be circumstantial (except the chicken dish), but, then again, how long has WT been a restaurant? Come on, I'm sure they've dealt with many a Saturday night rush and someone (ahem, manager??) should have at least come out to explain/apologize for their issues.

Love it.\n\nIt's mussel soup. I don't care if you don't like seafood, you will love this. You might think it's just sauce that the mussels are served in. It's soup. You will drink it, and you will wipe up every last drop with your fingers. There is nothing else like it. I'm serious. This is the stuff late-night cravings are made of. \n\nThe pad thai is good, but you can experiment here, ask the waitress for ideas, and know that you'll end up with something different and exciting. There are a few dishes that are acquired tastes (I'm learning to love wild boar), but because I eat here, I get to say \"I eat wild boar!\" and it makes me sound like a better person. And I'm pretty sure eating wild boar does make me a better person, at least to Lost groupies.\n\nMy main criticism is that they can sometimes hold back on the heat. It's not enough to say you want it hot. They'll assume you mean \"American hot.\" Make sure to specify \"Thai hot.\" The burn is good.\n\nYou must save room for dessert. This is essential. It will show you another side of Thai you may not have experienced before. I wouldn't go here just for desert, but drinks + dessert = win.\n\nThe inside is white tablecloths and candles. This is where you take a date, where the hostess will make sure you're happy and the waitresses will keep your glass always full. And you can see the kitchen from every table, so it feels like you're taking your date to a favorite neighborhood family restaurant (you are, and it is).  The only problem is the bar, which usually has a few sad people at it. I like to think it just adds to the neighborhood feel.\n\nThe patio is fun, with great seating arrangements, misters, and a vibrant atmosphere during the evening (don't sit here for lunch). It can be a little difficult to get service on the patio unless it's already packed. If you're with friends who want to hang out, choose the patio. It's great for spending the evening, with good drink service and lively conversation going on all around you.\n\nFinally, this is on a light rail stop, so there is absolutely no excuse not to make it part of your night out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

All were prepared very well.  The beef panang was a little different than I have had at many places here in town.  More curry & creamy coconut milk than the light broth based panang we have settled for at other places.  It was by far the best panang we have in Phoenix to date.  The beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top.  \n\nThe restaurant is very cozy and energetic.  It was 7:30 on a Thursday night and the inside was full, with only 1 table on the patio brave enough to weather the 100 degree heat.  Server was very friendly and attentive.  NA beverages were always kept full and she was all over refilling our glasses from the bottle of wine that had been ordered.  Big bonus points for the kitchen design.  It will not blow you away with tons of polished stainless steel and creative wall decor, but it is an open exhibition kitchen with about 10-12 seats at the bar that look in on the action.

I took a book, sat by myself and had a great afternoon. \n\nPrompt, friendly service. They kept my water full, that's all I require to leave a great tip. \n\nLots of choices on the menu, lots of drink specials. Parking in the back, or take the light rail. This is a great place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

That said, I must admit that the fried banana dessert was delicious!  Loved the toasted coconut on top (well, on top of the bananas, but under the syrup toppings, coconut ice cream, whipped topping, and maraschino cherry!).

[The same cucumber salad vinegarette at Siam Thai is more clean and crisp.] While green curry's are not generally my favorite (I often find them bland and less flavorful than a red), the beef green curry was tasty. The heat was one that built up slowly as you ate but was never overwhelming to the overall dish. The jasmine rice was cooked perfectly. \n\nWhile overall I can't complain, I can say I have had better but it is a worthy option when seeking a quick Thai fix.

Decha Boar celebrates the not often served wild boar in a peppery sauce of basil and telicherry peppercorns.  They understand that pepper can be flavorful in addition to hot, and there's a whole taste profile there just waiting for you to explore.  Best of all, the presentation on the dishes is a work of art - ribbons of carrots and beets as edible garnishes remind you of what a treat it should be to dine out.\n\nIf you are looking for standard Thai, without flair or panache, I could see how this might be seen as too expensive.

No rice at a thai restaurant?!?!  How do you run out of something so basic???\n\nAnyway, the must have remedied the situation because we did indeed get rice with our meals.  My husband ordered the wild boar.  He thought it was just okay.  I had the eggplant and tofu.  I asked them to add some thai pumpkin to it.  It was SUPER YUMMY.

By what I have read and now I interpreted the menu, I thought it was just fancy schmancy version of my fave Thai dishes. Since I'm not one to mess with classics, I didn't know how I'd like this spot. Wifey told me that tonight was the Thai New Year and they were going to have live music and dancers, so I figured uck it why not. What an awesome meal.\n\nWe started with the veggie sampler ($12.95) as our appetizer and a big ole $5 Thai beer. The sampler had the corn fritters, veggie egg rolls and tofu in peanut sauce. The corn fritters were other worldly, totally killer, I really enjoyed the tofu and the veggie rolls. What a great way to open up the meal.\n\nFor our meals, we split the Seafood Panang which was shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari and salmon in a spicy red coconut sauce. The ONLY part I didn't totally love was the calamari, it was waaaay chewy. Every other part was perfect. The shrimp were sweet and succulent, the scallops cooked to utter perfection, the mussels were done the was they're supposed to be not chewy, tender) and the salmon was something to slap my mama over. \n\nThe other dish we had to split was the Merry Mu (grilled pork served with coconut rice and carrot \"relish\"). The pork was perfectly seasoned sliced large pork pieces, the coconut rice was a sticky ball of semi sweet rice (not my bag, but I think some people would like it) and the carrot relish was more like a sweet carrot salad. It did come with this really peculiar (in a good way) green salty/bitter sauce that I kept going back to. I realized a piece of the pork, with some of the sweet carrot salad and the sauce had the total package. Wow. \n\nWe ended the meal with a stiff cocktail (I had this cosmo thing with sake, cranberry and lime juice that I had them serve me in a regular cup instead of the martini glass so I didn't look like a nancy) and wifey had a big ole slice of chocolate cake. Triple decker and all.\n\nWe ended up leaving around 720 or so, and the music was SUPPOSED to start at 7 but we didn't get to see it. Nevertheless, it was an awesome meal and I'm super stoked to have that cool Thai spot within walking/stumbling distance to the casa.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

Inside looked clean and the booths are rather private, which is neat. \n\nMy biggest complaint was the layout of the menu itself. This may sound kind of stuck up, but it really made a difference to me. It is kind of scattered looking and the selection, as it is presented, appears small. Plus, the menu doesn't obviously inform the customer that all their specialties and items that say they're made with this or that meat, can actually be replaced with another meat or tofu (if you're vegan or vegetarian like me). \n\nNeedless to say, I always value trying new restaurants, especially of my favorite cuisine. Wild Thaiger, unfortunately, probably won't be one of those places I insist on going to when I go to Phx though.

A bit too much sauce was on the noodles today, but adding the veggies really helped.  Next time I'm hoping to try the durian ice cream as well ;p", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

I can't think of a better place to have my birthday dinner. This place is fantastic!  The food was great and served with true elegance but in a casual setting. Even though it was a weekend evening and the place was absolutely packed, the service was great.  We were told right from the start that there would be at least a 20 minute wait and they were dead on in their estimate.  No problem at all.  I don't mind waiting if I'm told the wait time and it is accurate. \n\nThe atmosphere is relaxing, intimate and the decor is not over done as are so many Thai restaurants.  Can you say clean?  Even on such a busy night they kept the place almost spotless, even the bathrooms.  The kitchen is open to the dinning area and you can see how well managed and organized every thing is.  The kitchen staff looked like a well oiled machine in action.\n\nThe Food and Drinks:\nWell to start off, we didn't order any adult beverages this evening as we were going out to a local night club after dinner for our fill of libations. Instead I ordered the Iced green tea which was brewed to perfection!  I don't remember what everyone else had but I know one member of our party got the Thai Iced tea and said it was fantastic.\n\nAppetizers:\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table.\n\nDragon Eggs - These pork and crab stuffed dumplings were tender, tasty and served with a mild-tangy dipping sauce.\n\nSatay Sampler - Shrimp, beef and chicken skewers marinated in a tasty coconut curry and served with peanut sauce and cucumber chutney. Loved it!\n\nWild wrap - Spicy chopped chicken with a mint-lime sauce served with cabbage leaves. This tasted so fresh. Yes, spicy but very refreshing at the same time.\n\nVeggie Spring Rolls - Tender and crispy rolls stuffed with fresh veggies, cellophane noodles and served with a great plum sauce. They really were tender yet crisp, hot, tasty and the veggies tasted so fresh you would think they had a garden out back. I looked for it but found nothing but parking lot.\n\nHot Pot:\nWe also shared a Tom Yum Goong hot pot. The soup was nice and spicy, the shrimp was tender, the mushrooms had a rich earthy flavor and the lemongrass infused a wonderful aromatic hue to the soup.\n\nMain Course:\nI had the Ginger Fish. This is a breaded piece of salmon topped with mushrooms, onions, carrots and pineapple with a ginger sauce along with fresh sauteed veggies and rice. The presentation was first-class and portion size was very generous . In fact, I ended up taking about half of it home.  Trust me, it was so delicious that I really wanted to finish the whole dish but after all the appetizers and soup I thought I might explode if I didn't stop eating!\n\nOnce again, I cant remember what everyone else had but there were no complaints at all.\n\nDesert:\nOMG the Lemon Ginger Cheesecake is to die for!  Enough said. Period!\n\nWill I go back?\nI wish I lived in their back room so I could eat every meal there.\n\nHats off to The Wild Thaiger.\nThe best Thai food I have found anywhere in Arizona.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

I am giving this place 1 star based on the fact that my dinner companion and I couldn't eat more than 1 bite of the Mahi curry dish because it was so hot.  Don't get me wrong, I love spice, we have a multitude of hot sauces, chili paste and spicy oils in our home collection.  My companion loves, loves, loves things spicy, but when we both take a bite and can't actually taste any flavors of the dish, just burning lava, well it is simply to hot.  When we called our server over to let him know that the dish was way to hot to be palatable he asked if we wanted it boxed up.  Um no, please just take it away.  He didn't even ask if we wanted something different.\nHere is the kicker, when he brought our check the dish was still on it.  I called him over and asked for him to remove it for the obvious reason that we sent it back.  His response, \"Ohhh sorry!  It does say spicy on the menu.\"  I couldn't believe it.  I got charged $14.95 for a dish we couldn't even eat.  Totally lame.  A manager didn't even come over to try to smooth this issue out.

Most dishes are 7.95 with soup OR spring roll but not both. The vegetarian dishes are 8.95 and some of the noodle ones are closer to $10.\n\nService was fairly slow, less than ideal at lunch hour and surprising as they were not very busy. Another negative note is the open kitchen. I was able to see one cook use the microwave on something. Microwaves and gourmet never mix.\n\nI had the Veggie Kiewan 8.95 with a spring roll. The spring roll was nothing special. The green curry was quite rich and thick one of the richest in town. The vegies were good as was the tofu this is all topped with a beet garnish. Overall it was a good dish.\n\nMy co workers opted for the soup. It was a curry soup with chicken in it.

I didn't notice the sliced thai chilies that adorned the dish until I really dug in.  Phew!!  It was spicy and it was delicious!!!  The wild boar appeared and tasted like tender slices of pork.

If you don't love Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild Thaiger's.  :)  Seriously, this is one of the best dishes I've found in Phoenix.\n\nTheir other dishes are consistently good as well.  I love Chicken Satay, but most places only offer it as an appetizer, with a few skimpy chicken strips.  Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.\n\nTheir Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.  A must if you're eating anything spicy.\n\nThe service is very professional and timely.  The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.

I voiced my concern to Ola, she couldn't find it. But apologized. I was dissatisfied with this response and wrote her an email expressing my concerns. This is her appropriate, professional abbreviated response.\n\n\"As a regular you know we have an \"A\" rating because we don't have a pest problem.  I will be glad to share the pest inspection reports and monthly service schedule for the last eight years which we have been in business.  It would be a perfect world if I could afford to have enough staff to open all of our boxes in the parking lot and stock all of our products individually to ensure that unwanted pests do not enter our doors. Of course we have discontinued purchasing product from the supplier and they are aware of the problem.\"\n\nShe refunded my money, and we're satisfied, moved on. \n\nI show up today with my party---and she pulls me out of the restaurant, tells me that \"i'm not supporting her business\" and that a few days after my email she gets an inspection from the Maricopa County Health Department, and they gave her a \"B\" rating. She proceeds to accuse me of calling them, and blaming me for her low grade. I inform her that I dealt with her straight, communicated directly with her, and I considered it resolved. At this point she tells me she won't serve me anymore after being a customer for about seven years.\n\nHaving never dealt with the Maricopa Environmental Services, I'm not really aware with how they schedule their inspections but clearly it was a coincidence that it occurred 6 days later. I guess Ola never thought perhaps it was a different customer, or in fact that maybe it was scheduled every 3 months?\n\nAt any rate her reaction to customer feedback is not only unprofessional but just makes bad business sense. \n\nPoor decision Ola, I'm really surprised your sanitation problem, and failing an inspection is blamed on your customers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

Chef and owner Olashawn Hasadinratana-Weaver brings the traditional flare of Thai food to modern day Phoenix.  Wild Thaiger has had many TV personalities visit the place, but also celebrities that come by PHX.  I know because of the pictures posted in the back wall - haha!  Decorated with traditional Thai art; Wild Thaiger tries to emulate that Thailand feel along with your cuisine.  \n\nI've been here several times once for dinner and once for Happy Hour.  I'm a big fan of the fried noodles mainly Pad See Ew - Stir-fried fat noodles with your choice of protein; chicken, beef, or pork; and of course vegetables.  Seems pretty simple, but this dish packs a punch of aroma and spice.  It's usually fried in a garlic sauce and the amount of heat is based on how much you can handle.  I can't do the Thai spice I'll admit so I always do the medium.  In any case, Wild Thaiger deliveries with the Pad See Ew along with their traditional Pad Thai dish.  Another stir-fried noodle, but this one is with the skinny noodles and it's much sweeter.\n\nOverall, I would come here for Happy Hour because they have 1/2 off appetizers.

Truly a gorgeous spectacle of food.\n\nWe could not believe the cheap price, too...$9 for the pad thai. It was THE BEST pad Thai we've ever tasted, and we've had it all over the country. Because the place was packed on a Tuesday afternoon lunch rush we were seated at the bar and served right away.\n\nI had the Thai iced coffee, served elegantly in a tall ice-filled glass. Strong and sweet. My dining partner had tea served in a French press. We had a soup starter (the broth was perfection), shared a plate of fresh spring rolls, which are the best I've had since I ate them for the first time in 1985 at Arc En Ciel in Garland, TX, because Wild Thaiger uses mint leaves--the only way to do them in my book. They were not only delicious, and were accompanied by an exquisite peanut/citrus blend sauce with hints of anise...they were plated beautifully. Served two for $9.\n\nThe place is smallish....four booths and the rest tables, with a few  cafe height two-tops lining the hallway toward the bathrooms in the back that were obviously added out of necessity. The bar over looks an open kitchen where the owner/head chef prepares food next to assistant chefs. It is a show in itself.\n\nPhotos line the walls near the bathrooms and some of them are impressive--the head chef with some local celebrities and one with Steven Seagal. What were most impressive to us are the photos of their annual celebrations. Brightly costumed servers and performers...We want to know when these take place!\n\nIf you love Thai...GO THERE!", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

We started with the Island Crab, which is a crispy shell with crab meat on top - like a deconstructed wonton type of thing, only better! I love the fact that you can see and taste huge delicious chunks of crab, instead of the typical 95% cream cheese filling in most crab wontons. Awesome.

We looked to her completely confused she said that we could not dirty two areas of the restaurant. I couldn't believe what I was hearing! We said okay and could we sit at a table, that we will stay at for dinner,  we will understand if they couldn't get to us for the 25 minutes we can still sit and have a drink, she said no we have to stand there or sit on the bench waiting for a table for the 25 minutes or we cannot eat there!!!!  We left the restaurant and I will never return. I have now read the reviews how the service has sank. It's sad because it was a very enjoyable place at one time.

They were quick to accommodate me as a walk in.\n\nThe hair cut started off good.  He was very detailed and took his time with it.  The conversation was good, and having ESPN on was another plus.  However, him taking his time, started to take too long.  I can appreciate attention to detail, but when the guy next to us knocks out 2 haircuts before mine is done, then I start to wonder.\n\nThe straight razor shave was a pretty unpleasant experience, though in fairness, I think it was due to my thick 2 day stubble, and he had to change the blade twice.  If you don't have a thick beard, and have had straight razor shaves before, then this would probably be for you.  He used a hot towel a few times, and really did what he could to make the experience good.\n\nOverall, it took an hour and a half for a shave & a haircut, which is a bit too long in my opinion.  Also, the next day after a shower, I noticed that the hair on the left side of the top of my head is slightly longer than the right side.  All that time he spent on my head, and it still came out uneven?\n\nOne more plus is that they offer a 20% discount if you have the Passport card.

From rude staff to unpleasant odors or creepy guys giving you longing looks while you're just trying to figure out which one of your friends with an advanced degree in engineering you can text to help you figure out how to get on a machine without having it rip your arm out of its socket because the staff is not going help you without paying for a personal trainer or because you don't look like you were already born on a nautilus machine. \n\nThis gym is everything but. I went in because of the great introductory special and a recommendation of a friend. We're both training to swim the SF Bay for the 2011 Sharkfest Alcatraz Swim, so we needed a pool. \n\nAs soon you walk in, the guy at the front desk treats you like you're an old buddy and cracks jokes like he is your best bar buddy. Awesome attitude. The place has never been overly crowded (even at peak hours right after work. I've never gone during the early morning or lunch hours).\n\nNo waits on the machines and they have plenty of them. No waiting in the pool and even when there is a water aerobics class, one lane is left open to due laps. Hot tub, sauna, and some inexplicable walk in dunking tub (see, I'm not a gym aficionado or else I would know what that thing is for).\n\nTowel service, locks, and even gym shorts available. (no more using that excuse that you can't work out today because you left your work out clothes at home...they have some to check out there.)\n\nEven the seemingly cranky old lady doing her water workout was nice and called me sweetie and asked if I was ok when I inadvertently let out a puppy like whimper as my shoulder blades decided they wanted to cede from the union of my body. Note to self....don't do a month of the P90X with a friend, think you're hot stuff and on your way to a gym bod and then jump in a pool to do a mile swim without stretching because you think you're all that now. Had it not been for Grandma Water Aerobics, I might still be at the far end of the pool trying to inch my way back to the stairs hoping that the water on my face hid the tears that were going start gushing any minute if I couldn't make it to the hot tub to get my back to stop seizing up.  (Thank you, unknown Water Aerobics lady. You turned a moment of shame into motivation. Oh yeah, I will out swim grandma next time!)\n\nThe place is in the basement of an office building next to the seemingly abandoned Chateaux on Central development. Central and....Encanto (?) \nYou can park on the street (careful of the meters) or use the garage. The gym validates. \n\nThere is a downstairs weight room (I haven't check it out yet as I because there is a free gym at my job.) Yes, I like this place so much, I am paying for a gym membership even though I have access to work out facilities for free in my own building....including free personal trainer....but instead I get in my car come 5pm and drive to a gym I pay for because this athletic club is worth it. \n\nI saw no young kids running around. The clientele seems to be early  30s and up, young urban professionals and some retirees who are just trying to stay healthy. No creepy people ogling you (which you may be looking for) and no rude gym bunnies laughing at you in your leotard on the treadmill....but really....you shouldn't have the leotard and hot pink leg warmers on anyway...it is 2010.

I was a little baffled when the scheduler told me the next available appointment was not until a few weeks, seeing as I clearly stated I need to get my lump on my breast examined. I may only be 22 years old, and it may be rare for a 22 year old to have a malignant lump, but I do have a family history of breast cancer that was conceived early in their 20's. \n\nAs for my appointment, I had it scheduled at 7pm and I wasn't seen by the NP until 7:45. When the NP (nurse practitioner) came in, she checked out my lump and told me we need to get an ultrasound right away to make sure it isn't anything we need to worry about. When I had my pap smear she told me it looks like I have a yeast infection too. \n\nShe also gave me \"tips\" about keeping your vagina healthy such as Douching. First of all, this is HORRIBLE advice. Douching is the worst thing you can do for vaginal flora. This is the main reason why women get vaginal infections and bacterial vaginosis. I had to laugh at her but she is a NP, she knows what she is talking about...\n\nThere were two things that really bothered me about my appointment. The scheduler after my appointment told me she would call me the very next day to let me know the time of my ultrasound at Good Sam. I never heard from her the next day. This is very frustrating for me because I had to wait a while to even get in to see someone and now that I have a suspicious lump, I feel like we are just taking our time for something that needs to be a priority! Second thing is that I was clearly told I have a yeast infection and was not given any prescriptions to take care of it. \n\nI really feel like the office just does not care about my health or concerns and didn't do anything to make me feel comfortable. It was just a waiting game; wait for your appointment, when your appointment finally comes wait an hour for the doctor and wait some more to have an ultrasound scheduled. \n\nI will NOT go back here again.\n\n*update--I called to see why they hadn't called me back to schedule my ultrasound and they acted like I was dumb--saying that they gave me the order to schedule it somewhere else.

The last exam I had was when I was 17-18 at planned parenthood.  When you go into their offices for birth control they basically make you do an exam when you go in.  Well, I needed a new gynecologist and my boyfriend's mom recommended Central Phoenix OB/Gyn.  Since I hadn't gone to a professional before (besides planned parenthood) I thought I would give it a try.  The receptionist is VERY rude.  When we first got there we had to stand at the counter for 15 mins before she came out to give me my paperwork.  Her attitude isn't very welcoming, which is what pushed me away in the beginning.  First impressions are very important.  I had set an appointment with the Doctor, but come to find out that she wasn't in the office and they would have to schedule it with the NP (Nurse Practitioner).  I didn't get an exam like I was told, but she consulted me on my birth control and they took a STD test just so I could feel certain that I didn't have any.  They gave me a small discount for not being able to see the doctor ($185 Without insurance) and told me that they would contact me with the results from my test on Monday (a week from when I went).  Monday came and I got no calls.  I had another appointment scheduled not too far from then, so I decided to wait until I went back to the office.\n\nThe second visit I was scheduled with a doctor (that I did see that time) and was greeted by the oh so friendly receptionist.  I was told that they didn't have my test results (They LOST them) and that I would have to do another and they would take care of it.  They DIDN'T do any exam (AGAIN!) even though I was scheduled for it (I haven't had an exam for about 3 years now).  She just consulted me on the birth control and sent me on my way.  I had many questions, I have been having a lot of pain in my lower abdomen which is why I needed to be checked, and she just seemed to be rushing through all of them with no care.  I told her I was frequently urinating and I haven't been drinking a lot of water.  Her solution was that I was drinking a lot of water (I thought I just told her I didn't drink a lot) and that everything was fine.  I was a little frustrated, but that's fine.  I got to the front desk and I had to pay $250 for a consultation and no exam!  They called me a week later and I assumed it was for my results... NOPE.  They had \"forgotten\" to charge me, even though they told me since they screwed up the first time they would take care of it, and I had to pay another $250 for the lab!  That's ridiculous.\n\nThere are too many mistakes in this office for anyone to just overpass.\nI don't know if it's because I didn't have insurance, but they made me feel very unwelcome and like I couldn't afford anything in the office.\n\nPlanned Parenthood seems a lot more professional and welcoming...

The lady on the phone was not apologetic about the inconvenience as I had already planned to take the day we had arranged off from work. I had an appointment scheduled at 5:30 pm however due to bad traffic I was running late. I called to let them know and no one answered so I left a message. When I arrived the receptionist at the desk was rude again and told me that because I was  little late the doctor could not see me. I tried to explain that when I called no one answered and she again was rude and unapologetic. I am currently looking for another OBGYN.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1acmBPmmFDovVSHHzMrJ9A"}

Everyone in the waiting room was called before I was and I wasn't even seeing my actual Dr, I was assigned a PA instead.  I did the usual Urine sample, and they took my blood and vitals but the PA kept asking me questions I already answered to the nurse which made me notice she wasn't even looking at my file nor had it with her, she was just taking notes on the Patient info sheet I filled out.  She breezed through a low quality ultrasound and I had to ask her for pics which were blurry and barely even worth printing when I saw them.  She explained that I would be going to a different facility in 2 weeks for the ultrasound and then go back to their office for the check up which I wasn't happy about having to go to multiple places but understood.  When she finished I had to ask her about the results of the UA since I told her I felt like I may have a UTI, she told me everything looked fine but they would have to send it out to get those results (I've never heard of not getting UTI results the same day) and that she would just send a script for an antibiotic to my pharmacy which would be ready when I left there and that they would call in a couple days and tell me the results and I could stop taking them if they were negative.  I waited until the next day to go to the Pharm and no script was sent, I called the OBGYN and explained there was supposed to be a script for an antibiotic and they said they would send it over. the next day the pharm called to tell me my script for prenatal was ready but that was all that was sent. I didn't even ask for prenatals since they're over the counter!!!! called the DR AGAIN and had it sent over, still no call from the Dr regarding my results but I thought I would wait another day.  still a week later and 3 calls asking for my results and I had to call THEM to find out that the results had been in and are negative but the PA must have overlooked needing to call and let me know.  I have requested my file and am switching to Maricopa OBGYN, I'm very disappointed in my first prenatal Dr visit as this should be a happy time and your doctor should make you feel comfortable, I hope Maricopa can turn this around and make it a positive experience for me as it should be.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1acmBPmmFDovVSHHzMrJ9A"}

I couldn't leave it in the sad little box all alone at home.\n\nI took my new ring into a few stores to get quotes on the sizing and all of the places said I would have to leave it over the weekend because that is when the jeweler was working.  What a bummer!  The weekend is when I want to show everyone my new ring and announce my engagement.  It didn't seem like much fun to do one without the other.\n\nThen, on a Wednesday afternoon, I decided it wouldn't hurt to check with the jewelry store across the street from my office, Renaissance Fine Jewelry.  I had a few watch batteries replaced there a while back and was very happy with the quality and speed of the service.\n\nAfter showing the jeweler my ring, he was the first (and only) one to point out a few things about the ring that would cause challenges with the re-sizing process.  I was impressed.  Then he said he could I would most likely be able to pick up the ring on Friday.  That was music to my ears; I would have it for the weekend!!!\n\nHow could he do this so quickly when the other places wanted to keep my ring for 5-6 days?  I'll tell you why.  He is the guy; he IS the jeweler!  It is so nice to know that you are talking to the person who is actually doing the work!\n\nThe best part was I didn't even have to wait until Friday!!  My ring was ready for pick up less than 24 hours later!  Fantastic!  Yes, his price was a little higher than the other places, however for the upfront identification/notification of the challenges, the friendly service, and the speedy turnaround, it was worth every dime!\n\nNow if I only had more jewelry to take to Renaissance . . .  =)", "type": "review", "business_id": "cBH0kCvvUjQ9DBaAMUDSMw"}

Usually by 1, stores are stocked up, maybe one or two things to go.. \n\nThere was also a cockroach.. and not to sound snobby but the type of people that tend to go to this on, I feel I need to carry mace or have a buddy.. \n\nSo I may go back for quick in and out shopping, but for big shopping trips I'll drive out of my to somewhere else.. even with the gas prices..", "type": "review", "business_id": "7Z7IkR_-94AjUuDw0fbI7g"}

I will drive 15-20 miles to my nearest Sprouts or the Fancy Fry's in Scottsdale before I ever drive 1 mile to get to Safeway.\nIt's that bad.\nNot only is the parking lot notoriously sketchy with inconsiderate drivers abounding, but there are numerous problems inside the store, as well:\n1) You walk in to a rather dimly-lighted store, usually with a sour-faced security guard blocking your access to the carts.\n2) What carts you ask? That's a good question. Several times I have had to grab a handbasket because there were no carts in stock, even though I had a long grocery list to fulfill. I actually saw the cartboys leaning against the cartrails, laughing and having a heck of a time. Look, I get it, it's hot outside and you don't want to get get the carts, but C'MON!\n3) The first thing you see upon walking in may or may not be a ghetto display of moldy-looking fruit, or on  the 4th of July, a teenage employee roasting hot dogs on a bunsen burner with open containers of ketchup and mustard on a rickety table.\n4) Venture into the produce section, and you will meander through very difficult twists and turns that your cart may not even fit through. Please, managers, make sure that the spaces between fruit stands are at least cart-width!!!\n5) The line for the pharmacy extends into the produce area. Enough said.\n6) Expect for the aisles to have large space-blocking cardboard displays and/or fallen down merchandise and/or an employee restocking items right in the middle of the day. I would say half of the aisles are blocked at any given time.\n7) Once you have completed your hazardous journey of finding everything on your list, you must enter one of the two checkout lines, which are so long that they become another force blocking the aisleways. Two checkout lines, you say? Yes, only two, despite there being 5 or 6 total checkout lanes. If you are a young lady with any shred of fashion or hygiene, expect to be \"checked out\" by creepy older men whilst standing innocently in line.\n8) Your cashier will either be a surly teenage boy or a pregnant teenage girl who does a poor job managing the line and barely gives you the time of day and/or forgets to give you the receipt when you are done. But you are so eager to get out of there, you simply don't care to go back and ask for it.\n\nOh, and there may or may not be trash on the floor.\nIf Safeway as a nationwide brand prides themselves on safety or service, they need to get their corporate people in here to take a look at this store, and either condemn it or fire everyone who works here.\nIt's even more pitiful because they are the closest store to everyone who lives downtown, so they could easily be the most popular.\nPlease, downtown, replace this disgraceful store with a Whole Foods or a Sprouts or a place with a shred of human decency.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7Z7IkR_-94AjUuDw0fbI7g"}

And I love it. The servers are friendly, the place is beautiful, the best part is the outside patio. The only two negative things are the small bar area (happy hour is only in the bar) and the birds. The birds are cute, very chatty and will join you at your table to try and share your chips.\n\nThe food was great, I got the enchiladas which were tasty and I asked to change the side and the waiter was more then happy to let me do that. A friend got the Tuna salad which she enjoyed. I am not a fish person but she let me try her tuna and it was actually pretty good. The chips that come to your table are okay, I'm not a fan of the sweet potato chips, the texture and taste just do not work for me. So when I go I ask if I can just get corn tortilla chips, and they are happy to do that too. The salsa is a red smokey salsa which is good, but you can ask for green salsa which is just as good.. maybe better\n\nThe best part of this place is the Happy hour. The drinks are cheap and tasty. The best is the Grand Canyon Margarita which a mixture of orange, cranberry and prickly pear juices, its strong and only 3 bucks. The regular margaritas are excellent, on mondays that have a 10 dollar pitcher deal, a friend and I were able to get three each out of the pitcher. Good thing she lives in walking distance to the place. \n\nAnother good thing about the happy hour is the food. The bar has its own list of items in addition to the restaurants main menu. The best thing on that list is the chicken nachos, so good, best nachos I've had in a long time. Another is the cheese crisp with carnitas, very tasty.  Most of the items on this menu are around five dollars, and for five dollars you get a lot of food enough for two. \n\nI would highly recommend this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

If we ever return for dinner, I will update, but for now, I'll just say this place is really unremarkable and disappointing and that there are *way* better places to go for happy hour. \n\nWe went for happy hour on Friday around 5:45 pm and sat in the bar at one of the high tables. There were only 3-4 other people in the bar area, (and maybe 6-8 in the rest of the restaurant) but it still took the bartender about 5 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I got the Grand Canyon Margarita (featuring cranberry and citrus juices), and my husband got the Cactus Margarita (basically the house margarita). Both were $3. We wanted to order some bar food as well, but again, it took him about 10 minutes to return with our drinks and take our food order, even though the bar was still quite empty. After already being irritable with the slow service (having both worked in restaurants, we are very understanding of how stressful it is to handle a lot of tables or drink orders, but the restaurant was so empty that there was just no excuse), the slow service was not the only bad part of our first experience at Sam's Cafe. \n\nThe next negative was that the margaritas were so sweet and weak, they might as well just have charged us $3 each for juice. Then, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to get our bar food (carnitas cheese crisp, jalapeno poppers, and southwestern bruschetta) and when it finally came, it was all cold! We noticed that no one else in the bar area had gotten food, but all of a sudden, the bartender emerged from the back with an enormous tray of food and served everyone who had been waiting for food at once. Having worked in many restaurants, I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it's ready so that it doesn't get cold, and that as a server, I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn't for my table. Either the bartender should have been checking in the back more frequently for food that was ready or someone else (like the manager, who kept wandering around in a daze but never appeared to be doing much) should have done him a favor (if he was really that busy) and brought it out. \n\nThe third negative was that most of the food was not good at all. I know not to expect too much from bar food, especially when it was seriously discounted for happy hour, but two of the things we ordered were just bad. The carnitas cheese crisp was not light and crispy with gooey cheese; instead, it was a heavy and greasy flour tortillas covered in congealed cheese and dry shredded pork. Not good. The jalapeno poppers and boneless chicken wings were also terrible - Jack in the Box has better poppers and the chicken wings were straight out of a Tyson resealable bag. The Southwestern Bruschetta was fine, although it was very oily, and I have a hard time understanding how merely adding a ton of cilantro to a tomato mix makes something \"southwestern.\" None of the food items was more than $5, but I have been to *many* other happy hours where you can get solid, flavorful appetizers for between $2 - $5. Kincaid's and McCormick & Schmick's are two great examples. \n\nThe final kicker of our bad happy hour experience was when we asked the bartender for a check and he tried to pressure us to order more even though we said several times that we were finished. I believe the exact line was, \"Are you sure you don't want anything else? More drinks? More food? Some shots?\" Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think you should order more to *make* your experience somewhere better; rather, you should order more *because* you're having such a good time. As persuasive as his \"selling techniques\" were, we weren't (having a good time), so we didn't (order more).", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

You all were obviously on crack when you ate here. Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.\n\nWent at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.\n\nThey started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?\n\nWe decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.\n\nI thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill. \n\nOverall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware? We had to go steal it off another table.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

The service overall was really friendly and prompt and I didn't have a whole lot of complaints on that end.\n\nMy one complaint? The portions served. I got a chimichanga that looks like a fried burrito from chipotle with a side salad. It was a pretty good chimichanga, but i didn't feel that great after eating the body weight of a newborn with a side salad to boot. As you can tell, I'm not big on leaving anything on my plate. \n\nLastly, the cherry on the frosting for me was the white chocolate pecan dessert thing they give you at the end. It's their version of the chocolate mints that they give you with the bill. Come here to eat, don't come here for fine dining.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

The two split plates were more than enough food for a regular meal. I can't imagine eating a whole one and I am a hearty eater. We also each ordered a Rico Rita. Yummy and again large portions.

If you are out of town the location can be a tricky as it is inside a shopping plaza.  Most of the group was about 10 mins late (I know I know...sad when most of us have GPS capable mobile phones).  We found it due to the friendly local police and Downtown Phoenix greeters (?).  \n\nThe restaurant did not have a private room (we had a group of 15) but we were there really early.  The chip basket is AMAZING!  It has a bunch of different chips from tortilla, to different types of potates and even these fried pieces of goodness (that reminded me of wontons).  The salsa was really good too.  The waitstaff was great....they provided lots of these chip baskets during our 3 hour meeting.  When the meeting concluded...it was straight to the top shelf margaritas which we've been dying for since we sat down.  It's a great deal for top shelf tequila and the quantity.  You get about 2-4 drinks as they even give you some reserve in the cocktail shaker.  \n\nFood was good.  I had the sirloin which was cooked perfect at medium.  My friend sitting next to me ordered the same thing at medium rare but got it well done.  She sent it back and after a few minutes got a new one closer to the rare side but she was happy.\n\nIf I lived in the area and was able to visit again I could consider becoming a fan of this place.  Definitely check it out.  Another plus - they have a patio too!", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

I couldn't believe that I had never been here before and I was excited to try a new place, so I could Yelp about it, of course!\n\nMy co-workers and I walked up on the wrong side of the cafe and came through the patio area.  Normally, I don't think this would have been a problem, however this night they had the majority of the patio roped off for a private function and we looked like we were trying to crash it.  Oops.  No harm done, they still let us into the restaurant.\n\nWhile waiting for everyone in the group to arrive, the two girls at the hostess stand were watching us with little to no expression on their face.  I felt a little uncomfortable, they were not friendly and welcoming by any means, but they eventually sat us none the less and our service was great from there out.  We decided to sit inside as it was a little warm outside.\n\nThe server was nice and even joked around with us a bit.  I ordered the Orange Beso margarita.  It was good, since it was made with vodka instead of tequila, it wasn't quite a margarita for me, but hey, it tasted good.  Since they drop off the shaker so you can refill your own, it was the margarita that seemed to never end.  That made me happy!\n\nPlenty of other people have mentioned the cool assortment of chips and the great salsa so I won't get into details.  I just leave it that I loved both!\n\nFor my meal I ordered the Black & Blue quesadilla.  It sure was yummy!  The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly and as I've mentioned in many other reviews, the right amount of blue cheese is always a winner in my book.  This quesadilla was right on the money, not overpowering with the blue cheese.  I ended up taking half of it home.\n\nAs plenty of other reviewers have mentioned, the white chocolate tamale was great finish for the meal.  I'm not so big on desserts, but I usually crave a bite or two of sweet to finish lunch or dinner and this did the trick!\n\nI can't wait to go back on the weekend to relax on the patio, drink some margaritas, and try more food.  I think next time I'd like to try some tacos . . .", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

The basket of chips included blue corn, yellow corn, sweet potato and surprisingly the best of the bunch, fried won ton skins with Navajo spices. The salsa was pretty good though when my friend asked for something spicier, all they did was dump some cayenne pepper into the same salsa and serve it in a different shaped bowl.\n\nWe started with the cheap happy hour margarita, which was better than expected to their special Commemorativo margarita, which was served to us in the shaker. For the price, it was a lot of margarita with a lot of tequila and it was tasty. Can't beat that...except maybe with a couple of rounds of Patron.\n\n I knew I was in trouble, though, when I asked the waiter to recommend a vegetarian dish and he suggested the veggie pasta with black beans and ginger soy sauce. Not sure why I listened to him when every part of my being told me not to order pasta at a Mexican restaurant. But I did. My pasta came with three toothpick thin pieces of asparagus, one mushroom, two pieces of zucchini and a little pile of spinach. There were a few black beans hiding in the noodles which were slightly tinted brown, supposedly the Ginger soy sauce. It was the worst meal I have had in a very longtime and a total disappointment to say the least. I tried a piece of my friend's tuna and it was overbooked, try and bland.\n\nAll in all, this place got one star for their margaritas and one star for their chips.

The Chicken taco salad was better than the steak.\n\nThe chips and salsa at first appeared to be very impressive as many other Yelpers have mentioned however your either a fan or not a fan.  I'm not a fan unfortunately...  The chips were too greasy with way too much of their seasoning!  I especially did not like their salsa.  It had no heat and HUGE chunks of tomato's! YYYEEAA~UCK.  Way too much work to get to the little bits of salsa that were actually kind of good.  I asked for a different salsa, my server just brought us some hot sauce to add to the salsa. Some of folks at our table did like their chips and salsa though. The Grand Canyon Margaritas were very good and a recommend from me to you.  \n\nSuggestion: seek out the \"Info-dude\" that walks around the Mall area to show people where to go and ask him for some coupons.

I figured since I'm here for a few days, that it would be nice to try something that is \"Southwestern\".\n\nCame here for lunch and it was relatively empty and I sat at the bar. Nice clean area, with a couple of tv's for the sports fanatics. The servers were pretty friendly too. Although some of the servers were super bored since there were not a lot of customers.\n\nAgain, I wanted something Southwestern so I went with their Desert Fire Pasta. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?select=AykZwJA1xSgxLOBaWbWHOg It's basically shrimp and fresh mushrooms over angel-hair pasta in a jalape\u00f1o cream sauce. Topped with Parmesan cheese and pico de gallo. This pasta was pretty much soaked with butter. Is that a typical Southwestern thing? Because if so, I would feel light headed all the time if I lived here.\n\nAnd for dessert, I got their fried banana burrito with ice cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?select=PpE4HMvbpTU7mJdb19VlZA. Nice presentation actually. It's a great theme for a Southwestern style dessert.\n\nTip: Use your yelp check in to get a free dessert.\n\nOverall, a decent experience, though just a bit fattening to me with all that cream and butter. \n\nWent to downtown a couple of times, and this place was desolate.

Prior to ordering I checked out other Yelp reviews just as you are now and the things that stood out to me we're the chips and salsa and the margaritas. Well, everyone said it and I'm gonna say it too! You must try the chips and salsa (my favorite chip is the wonton chip, a little sweet heat! Yum!) and of course to go with it get the top shelf conmemorativo margarita...so, so, so good! I also got the spinach and portobello mushroom quesadilla and it was good. \n\nIt was so Delish that I brought a different large group of friends back to this place. Unfortunately, the restaurant was much busier and I'm not sure they handled the large crowds very well. We were told 1 hour wait, but after 20 minutes our buzzer went off. When we gathered our group to be seated the hostess told us it was a mistake and asked us to wait off to the side in the dining area. This wait was another hour before we approached the hostess. She was very rude and told us it would be 'awhile' but wouldn't give us a time frame. When we asked if it would be 10? 30? 1 and a half hours? She said it would be at least that! Unacceptable when we were told an hour wait. I asked to speak to a manager and Tony was extremely responsive! He worked it so that we were seated right away! The server  was fantastic as she stepped in to take our large party and we were seated outside her section. The chips and salsa came out quickly and she was great with getting us drinks (of course I had another round of the margarita) and the food was great. This time around I had the salmon. So delish! And the desserts were covered by the server as an apology for our wait. \n\nThe manager Tony was great, responsive and helped me to overcome my disappointment in the rude hostess encounter and he brought me back to a 4 star rating for the great service and food once we were seated.

Well, I just got back from eating dinner here, and I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do more than write this review -- that's how good it is. \n\nI'm in town for business and a buddy who lives in the area suggested this place for dinner tonight, and boy am I glad he did! \n\nLet me start with the ambiance. Very nicely decorated and furnished in the Southwestern style that is common down here but done nicely, not gaudy or tacky in any way. There is a nice outside patio seating area, however considering I'm from Seattle and the temp was still pushing 100 degrees, we opted to sit inside.\n\nOnce we were seated, we were tempted to order the \"Limit-2\" margaritas that they are apparently famous for, but decided against it. After taking our drink order, the waitress brought us a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa.\n\nLet me stop right here.\n\nI knew just from looking at them, that these were no ordinary chips . Not only were they a mixture of different types of chips (regular tortillas, sweet potato, and wontons), but each type was topped in a different seasoning -- my favorite being the wonton chips topped in seasoning and some powdered sugar, giving it a sweet and spicy flavor at the same time. Amazing. I asked the waitress what the seasoning but I swear they were laced with cocaine as well. Hands down the best chips and salsa I've ever had in my life. I would go back just for that!\n\nOnce we overcame the confusion of what the \"Super Salad\" was (it turns out she was asking if I wanted soup OR salad), I ordered the Pueblo House Salad to start with. It was a very nice sized salad (could easily have been shared by two people if someone wanted to), and delicious with their honey chipotle vinaigrette dressing.\n\nFor the main course, I opted for the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast, which came off the \"Sam-Mex\" section of the menu. According to the menu, \"Sam-Mex\" was created by their executive chef with \"the influence of Mexican, Spanish, Native American and American Southwest Cultures.\" The chicken breast was stuffed with herb-goat cheese and served over a roasted red pepper cream sauce with a pine nut & cilantro pesto, grilled asparagus and southwest rice.\n\nWords cannot describe the amazing fusion of these different flavors as they combined into one superbly mind blowing dish.\n\nI'll be honest, it was hard to concentrate on the conversation with my buddy as I was distracted each time I took a bite -- but don't let him know I said that!\n \nAt the end of the meal, as we opted not to order dessert (or the crazy margarita), we were treated to what the waitress referred to as \"white chocolate tamales,\" compliments of the chef. Of course, know that I have read some of the other reviews on here, it seems that everyone gets these little treats, but whether the chef really intended for us to specifically have them or not was a mute point after tasting them -- a great finishing touch on an amazing meal. \n\nWhile I don't often get down to this part of the country, I will always have fond memories of this little \"cafe\" called, Sam's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

You don't even need the salsa as the chips are seasoned, fresh and uniquely delicious. Husband had the chicken quesadilla and inhaled it before I could try it but he loved it. I was torn between the Stuffed Chicken and the Spinach and Portobello quesadilla. I had (and loved) the chicken dish my last visit so I went with the spinach and mushroom quesadilla which was wonderfully simple and delicious with a fresh and tasty salad on the side. We didn't have time for dessert but again, not to worry as the complementary white chocolate nibble they serve at the end of the meal hits the spot. Next time we come to Sam's we will hopefully have more time for appetizer and dessert. I also need to commend the attentive wait staff and pleasant atmosphere especially when the weather allows you to sit outside", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

We sat out on the patio and enjoyed the most amazing chips + salsa which many people have raved about on Yelp.  Towards the end of the meal, manager Nicole dropped by the table to ask how the meal was and we enjoyed talking with her. She was very knowledgable about the city and the restaurant which I was surprised to find has a sister cafe in my town (St. Louis). I thought the food was good but not amazing. But the chips, atmosphere, service and overall relaxing evening made this a 5-start experience.

You must go and you MUST have the chips and salsa...YUM!\n\nThen, dinner.  And it was fast and delicioso!  I had the Black and Blue quesidilla and my partner had a pork dish and holy cramoly...amazing.  Not only was the service fabulous and fast, but the attention to detail was truly surprising AND, did I mention the food was fantastic!\n\nThen we met up with Nicole - manager extraordinaire and a really nice person to socialize with during dinner.  She came over and asked how our dinner was going and then shared stories of her experiences with us and what's cool (and not so cool) about Phoenix.  Always great to hear it direct from a local . . . thanks Nicole, you made our evening really special.\n\nAnd then finally, after all was said and done, our waitress Sally brought these little corn-husk wrapped fingerlings of vanilla infused white-chocolate with pecans encrusted throughout.  Seriously...just shoot me!\n\nI'd give Sam's a 10 star rating, but then again, this is my first time reviewing a restaurant so, it's a pleasure to start off my Yelp career with such a great and wonderful place.  PLUS, there's a Canyon Cafe' restaurant (parent company of Sam's) about 10 minutes from my house in St. Louis so as soon as I get back home, I'd headed there for more fun and food.\n\nThanks Sam's...WOW!", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

Sitting outside on the patio under the gorgeous sparkling lights on the palm trees, with the sound of the running water in the fountains nearby, in the heart of Central Phoenix.  It didn't even matter at that point if the food was good!   \n\nI've been back several times since and this place doesn't disappoint.  However, I would rank ambiance #1, alcohol #2 and food #3.  Drink choices are widely ranging so everyone will find something.   From your traditional margarita to a cocktail, the drinks are strong and well made.  As for the food, I've had a few dishes I liked - the black and bleu quesadilla and the fajitas tend to be my go-to.  I love the salsa too - it's a chipotle, smoky flavor - my favorite kind!   Best little treat is a white chocolate dessert served in a corn husk at the end of the meal.   Great little inclusion!   \n\nThis is located in the Arizona Center by the AMC movie theater, so makes it easy for a great dinner and movie night.   Then grab your date's arm and take a stroll through the courtyard, enjoy the twinkling lights and fountains.   There's no way you'll be able to resist the romance!  =)", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

For a meal i picked the Meatloaf and it was a ton of food.  2 huge pieces meatloaf that was seared on a grill after it was cooked came out with corn & mashed potatoes and a roasted tomato BBQ sauce.

I don't know if they've changed management or service since they changed their name to Canyon Cafe but the service here frustrated me so badly I had to give it 2 stars for \"I've experienced better.\"  The wait for food is rather long most times of the day, which, at lunch time especially, can suffice as a reason NOT to go here. You definitely won't make it back to work within an hour.  \n\nBut here's the main reason I started boycotting Sam's. I went here with a friend who is allergic to cilantro once. She tried ordering 4 different things that presumably wouldn't have cilantro on them and each time she selected something the waiter just said \"That has cilantro too.\" How about helping to identify some items WITHOUT cilantro, Mr. Waiter?! When she had finally just decided NOT to eat at all, I asked the waiter if he could go ask the cook if he could make anything without cilantro so my friend could eat.  Rather than doing that, he said, \"well, I know all the ingredients in everything so that won't help.\" Nice. Finally I asked the waiter if the chef could make a quesadilla (tortillas & cheese!!!!!!) without cilantro and he STILL said no.  Do you know why? Because it's served with pico de gallo on top. HELLO?!?! just leave it off....idiot. It was really a terrible experience. Usually restaurants at least ATTEMPT to accommodate food allergies. NOT this one. \n\nTHEN, to cap it all off, I asked for parking validation for the garage when we were ready to go. All restaurants at the Arizona Center give validation for parking because why would you pay an additional $5-$10 just to eat at so-so restaurants?  The hostess responded with a simple, \"Sorry - we're out\". I had no patience left after the no-cilantro fiasco so I inquired further and finally a manager came out and said, \"Oh - no parking? - I'll go get more validations from our sister restaurant around the corner.\" He was back in 1 minute. How difficult was that? The lack of problem-solving skills among the staff here really astounded me, and for this reason, despite the fact that this place is super convenient to my job and home, I haven't been back since.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

It's a good thing the kitchen is quick because my Cobb salad that came out a short time later was gigantic.  I would probably say this is one of the top Cobbs I have ever had - every item on it tasted fresh and crisp and good quality, and there were a lot of unique items included - oh so much more than your average Cobb.\nI planned all week to go back at night for dinner and margaritas but never did make it - boo!", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

We all choked back a swig to verify and then asked Ryan to add something to tone it down, which he did rather quickly. K & I were intrigued by the \"Limit 2\" Margaritas so we each ordered the Top Shelf ConMemorativo which I have to say was just average. Pricey ($11.95) for average.\n\nDinner selections included the carnitas platter, a spinach/portabella quesadilla, and some kind of stew with jalapenos and all kinds of tasty things...beef? pork? Can you tell this wasn't my dish? I did however, get to taste it and all of us had wished we'd ordered it. It was that good. The report on the quesadilla was that it was good and just enough food. The carnitas were a little dry but the plate arranged beautifully. Canyon serves an odd chips & salsa combo too - puffy fried flour tortillas (my guess on the flour) and then sprinkled with a sweet, BBQ flavoring. Interesting. They were good but we could only eat a couple each.\n\nThe best part about Canyon for us was Ryan! He was super friendly, super attentive without annoying us and accommodated all our requests...even one for a picture!", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

I've had dinners, salads, quesadillas there and everything has always been good.  I'd always take my assistant there for secretaries day or for their birthdays and they always love it.  We've had out of town visitors and they always love it too.  If you love calamari, there's is great.  IT's cornmeal dusted with a spicy sauce... but there's TONS... so bring friends.  Really.  Usually a calamari order is $10+ and so small you don't want to share, this is under $10 and enough for 5 ppl.  Delish.  I LOVE that they bring you a white chocolate (and pecan) tamale after dinner.

I want this place to succeed, I really do, but based upon a couple of my experiences here it seems they themselves do not want to succeed.\n\nCanyon Cafe has a really nice location in downtown Phoenix at the Arizona Center. One of its main selling points is the huge shaded patio overlooking the Arizona Center courtyard with tall palm trees and soothing waterfalls. They have some of the best margaritas I've ever tasted. The food is mediocre.\n\nMy first three times here last winter were great. Canyon Cafe was one of my first restaurant experiences in Phoenix, as I had just accepted my first big boy job and had relocated from Pennsylvania. I was in love with the new climate and the countless varieties of margaritas. The food was so-so, but the atmosphere and service received were wonderful. My server was the older lady with shorter gray hair--perfect! \n\nMy fourth time was on a Friday night, and we arrived to a surprisingly empty restaurant around 8:30 for dinner. The chile-rubbed sirloin left a lot to be desired, but the Orange Beso margaritas were its saving grace. I really love these margaritas, and I highly recommend this place for margaritas, and margaritas only, but only if you want to stop drinking them by 10pm on a Friday night. I didn't know they closed at 10pm on a Friday night until the server presented me the check at 10pm saying that they close at 10pm on Friday nights. Seriously? I'm not one to consciously stay past closing time, but giving one of your few remaining repeat customers the proverbial 'foot in the ass' is probably a big reason as to why you have no one in your restaurant on a Friday night. That, and you don't have a HH to lure customers in earlier in the evening. Get with the program.\n\nIn the spirit of redemption, I came here solo for a late lunch yesterday. The place was nearly empty, but that's to be expected at 4pm on a weekday. I picked a nice patio table overlooking the courtyard on an absolutely beautiful 80 degree day. I sipped on my Blue Moon margarita, wayfarers on, giving thanks I wasn't in the torrent of shit that was unloading on the east coast. I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad and went back to sipping and basking. Five minutes later my waitress returns asking me what I ordered. Sip.\n\nThis particular Caesar salad has apple and pear slices in it, which sounded deliciously refreshing. I was let down when the bowl arrived and the pieces were about the width of a toothpick. The salad and dressing were great, but the salmon tasted too fishy, leading me to believe it was old. \n\nI'm about halfway finished with my margarita when my server drops the check, not even asking me if i'd like another margarita. There are literally three tables in the entire restaurant and I feel like I'm being rushed out again. I don't touch the check, but proceed to sip, people watch, and check my phone to see how the market did. Ten minutes later she opens the check presenter that's on my table,\n\n\"Oh, you're not finished?\"\n    No.\n\"Just enjoying the weather?\"\n    ..........\n\nI think I'm finished now. I'm finished with this restaurant. This place is a headache. Also check out their website. It looks like something I could have created using Visual Basic in high school. This place reeks of complacency. 2 stars only because of the margaritas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

Again, beautiful atmosphere from the patio. The chips and salsa were DELICIOUS!!!! The food and service were mediocre. I had the chicken sandwich which sounded somewhat healthy but came out greasy. \n\nSo my advice: go!! Get the chips and salsa. Although I didn't have one, I hear the margaritas are good, too.

Some where deep fried, different flavors, and overall a great way to start the meal. I had the carnitas plate and it was very moist and portions were plenty. The flavor was very good. We also took advantage of a yelp check in free desert and the banana burrito was great with banana wrapped in a crispy sweet tortilla topped with ice cream.\n\nThe food was great and vibe was really nice on a nice breezy, summer day. The waitress was very helpful, good service and the chef actually brought out samples of desert that I can not remember the name but it was a nice touch.

It was bizzare rolling up in a RVCA tee and a pair of cargos and Reefs while the other partrons were having some kind of Royal Family flashback in their feathery headpieces and pinkys skyward.\n\nBut whatever.  I ALWAYS sat outside under their very large oak(?) trees that shade most of their front area.  This was great for some serious people watching ... mostly tourist wondering why Bianco is closed at noon, but attempting the door anyway.  They would eventually mosey over to Teeter ... good for them!\n\nAnyhow, back to this sandwhich.  Its unbeleivable and pretty large with a side of rosemary potato salad and some fruit.  Teeter house also serves beer and wine, which was always nice.  They have a pretty good selection too.\n\nMy only complaint is that they open too late (for morning coffee -- although once i guess i looked thoroughly disappointed that they weren't open yet early on a Sunday while they were setting up and gave me a free coffee-to-go anyway!) and they close way too early.

The decor was not as quaint as I was hoping, more like old grandma grunts than chabby chic and garden like. Country not Victorian. Anyway, it was the experience we were looking for, and my wife had been here before. \nWell, we started off with a brand new waitress, nice girl, but zip on the training, than a girl with three months experience came out, again, no training. Both of these girls would seem happier in a less than Victorian life. We asked about teas and blends, but had no assistance. They only offered a couple and you had to share the pot! What is the deal with that - for $19 bucks a pop I wanted my own pot of earl grey while my wife sipped on apricot! \nWell, one waitress was quitting that day and decided to slam her boss over and over again to us, we were about to leave when the owner came out - we said it was not the experience we were looking for, she apologized and the service got slightly better. Where were the tea cups - we had punch glasses and cracked porcelain with stains. No plates at first, the tea was nothing to write home about. \nMy daughters tea was ok, the cookie was boring, artless and lacking in any frosting or style. The finger sandwiches were pretty good - not quite British, more like deli style, but tasty. The scones a bit dry and the jam, maybe WalMart strawberry.  The worst was the dessert. COSTCO SPECIAL! Little dainties of mini eclairs and mini cheesecake squares still frozen with some Rheddi Whip Cream on the side. My six year old loved as she has a dairy intolerance and took an enzyme and she got to splurge. All of this with the griping trainer and the poor helpless trainee for 19 bucks a person. What else could you ask for? A REFUND - which the owner graciously gave us. The place has potential - but needs to work out the kinks, up the presentation, get a better scone recipe, take some time to learn about teas and train their staff, and YES - learn to bake desserts! A 3 tiered plate for presentation and some real tea cups would be nice too!

Buying a gimmicky electric bike could be a bad decision.  Buying electronics from a produce market could be questionable decision.

But some how myself and dozens of other logical people have had a excellent to OK experience when doing all of the above.\n\nPhoenix Produce is selling Fujiton E-Bikes straight off the boat from China.  And we're not talking \"Made in China\" hidden in some innocuous spot; this is legitimately Chinese...from the oddly sized tires (which makes it a little difficult to find tubes for) to the Mandarin/Cantonese (not actually sure which) that fills the instrument panel and indicator lights.\n\nPhoenix Produce carries two models 36v and 48v both have max speed of 20 MPH.  While they differ in range 22 miles and 30 miles, respectively, on a single charge.  The motor definitely has good torque for a little electric motor...I've heard the 48v is even better than my 36v.  Both plug directly into a 110V (normal) outlet.  The 36v costs a little more than 3 CENTS per charge. These are bikes, so you can ride them on sidewalks or other bike designated paths.  No license/registration/insurance/helmet required (legally per ARS 28-2516)...though the helmet is recommended.\n\nAs for the no warranties and returns part...I can only say what I've experienced.  Sam, the owner of Phoenix Produce, has been very good to me in all my dealings.  I had some initial problems with the battery and charger of the bike, making the first week of ownership less than stellar.  Fortunately, I talked to Sam about those issues and he corrected the problems no charge...sure seemed like a warranty; but Jenny, one of his employees, said \"He is just really fair.\"  And I have to agree.

I think it has something to do with the fact that Pope John Paul II visited this basilica years ago for World Youth Day. \n\nI've been going to St. Mary's Basilica for years. Ironically enough, Father Vince, who is a priest at St. Mary's Basilica, used to be the priest at St Isidore's in Danville, California which was the church I went to when I was growing up. \n\nDuring the holidays, I make sure I attend mass at St. Mary's Basilica. There's something about the architecture, music, and Mass that makes this a perfect church for those times. However, it's also a great church for Sunday mass. \n\nAround 7 years ago, my sister married her husband at St Mary's Basilica  and I was lucky enough to be the Maid of Honor. The wedding was a full Mass and made it such a special day for my sister, her husband, myself and everyone who witnessed the ceremony. \n\nThere isn't much more I can say about St. Mary's Basilica in this review, but I will end this by saying that each Mass is a different experience and it's based on the person attending, but be sure to visit this church and attend a Mass so see if it's right for you.", "type": "review", "business_id": "545sP7uSdCcKDZ-reeVOgQ"}

Instead, the mass kept ascending in circles like the incense. It was like a holy party, with all of creation joining in the celebration of its Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\n\nThe mass was sung and prayed much more than spoken. There were traditional carols, Latin chants, and pieces of Handel's Messiah. The choir did wonderfully as the happy voices of those gathered were all taken up and transfigured as if by one power.\n\nThe celebrant was Father Vincente Mesi whose beautiful, crystalline voice sang out and chanted the prelude to the declaration of Christ's birth as well as the Gospel reading from the pulpit.\n\nBy 2 am the people began to stream out of the church with the bells tolling from the towers unabashedly with good news, pounding with a rebellious happiness against the tall, dark downtown buildings and skyscrapers of Phoenix. The bells sang the happy triumph, the surprise victory of love and meekness, over the pride and might of the world.\n\nMany, though no doubt not all, felt they had encountered the mystery of a happiness and joy that strips and transcends all human understanding. Many, though no doubt not all, walked away with their hearts full of this sacred joy. Those who did were at least for a moment transformed by this eternity--this holy party which is Christmas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "545sP7uSdCcKDZ-reeVOgQ"}

It's not huge, but they make the most of their space, including short films, longer presentations, and a huge display of kachinas in telling the cultural stories of Southwestern Native Americans. Importantly realizing that Native American cultures are not dead, the museum contains modern artwork and filmed interviews with members of today's Native American tribes. The amount of information given is detailed but not overwhelming, and I would say that the museum represents an excellent introduction to Southwestern Indian culture.\n\nOne could complain that the Heard Museum doesn't document any of the internal Indian wars or strife, but on the other hand ,considering the racism these groups still come up against, perhaps its for the best that the rest of us just learn about how complex and beautiful these cultures often were and are. \n\nA final note should be given to the beautiful museum itself, which may be the only time I'll ever use the world \"beautiful\" to describe any building in Phoenix. It resembles images I've seen of Roman villas and its courtyard is very mellow, with a nice cafe and pools of running water.

We were there for almost 2.5 hours and the time flew by.  The permanent exhibit was laid out nicely and I truly learned quite a bit that I did not know previously about Native Americans.  In fact, I had no clue how many different tribes call Arizona and New Mexico home and reading the history and how they are now was quite fascinating, but I am a history nerd. The Remix contemporary exhibt was well-done and was my favorite portion of the whole museum, but I'm a sucker for contemporary art and installations.  We even wondered about the \"children's area\" and that was also well done with a variety of hands on crafts and activities for little peanuts (heck, my husband and I even did some of them! hehe).   The boarding school exhibit on the second floor was very nicely done and well laid out...the testimonials that played while you walked around were quite touching and at times I felt myself tearing up.\n\nAdult admission is $10 and students are only $5. My husband forgot his ASU student ID and when he mentioned it to the cashier, the guy was like, \"oh that's OK\" and gave us the student admission anyway. Very nice.  There were quite a few people at Heard while we were there, but I never felt rushed or that I was in someone's way, which I think speaks highly of the layout.  I definitely recommend the museum if you have an afternoon you are looking to fill and/or just want to learn more about Native Americans.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg"}

It depicts the Navajo Creation Story and is intricate and beautiful.\n\n- The Hopi Wedding Dress inside the Homelands Exhibit\n\n- The Photograph of the Grave yard outside the Indian School in the Boarding School Experience. \n\n- The Statue of Native women outside the museum. \n\n- The Yazzie Mural inside the We Are exhibit. It depicts the story of the Navajo and Yaqui Tribe's modern history. \n\n-The beaded chucks in the Shoes exhibit! I want a pair!!\n\nWhen it comes to the Heard's Gift shop: now this place is amazing!! Many of their pieces are authentic and hand crafted. BUT THERE ARE FAKES AMONG THEM!!! Feel free to ask a lot of questions. Even try to negotiate prices. You never know, some of those pieces have been there for YEARS! Demand certificates of authenticity. Ask to know the meaning of symbols and designs. Know what materials they're made out of! \n\nThere could be two bracelets that almost identical and one could be silver plated and one could be solid silver. And they could both be priced the same. ASK QUESTIONS!! Ask to try to stuff on. They are usually pretty nice about this, except when it comes to earrings. Many hard to find books can be found here. Whenever someone is doing a research project, the Heard is one of the first places I recommend. I recommend the photography books.\n\nTheir exhibits are always changing. So check the website and see what's new. Have fun, bring a friend, and open your mind and see the many wonderful facets of Native American Culture.\n\n****UPDATE****\nOne of our fellow yelpers Deb K. http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sGzHUN7UpjXUGKckrv-bTw has sent me private messages asking me to edit my review and I am! She believes and knows that all the pieces are authentic at the Heard's Gift Shop. \n\nShe has said and I quote: \"Hi Cher, Deb K. here--actually, I do work at the Heard and I can tell you that everything that we sell is authentic.\"  and she even goes on to say, \"Maybe you're thinking about those dreamcatchers and whatnots in the back? Even those have to come from a Native-owned and operated establishment. [although I do agree they're kind of tacky, but you know the bilagaanas (White People)...they do like their kitschy stuff]\" And what really got me was: \"I really feel you should go back and change the part about the shop offering 'fake' items\". \n\nAs a Native American, sometimes it's a love/hate relationship with the Heard. The Heard is the premier launching pad for non-natives in this city to experience Indian Country but sometimes it comes at a price. We are often objectified and practically forced to share that which is sacred to us. But it's allowed and it's a choice that each Native artist that has dealt with has the Heard made for themselves. \n\nThere is an unequal representation of Tribes on display at the Heard, the Navajo exhibit is HUGE at the Heard and yet the O'odham exhibit is medium sized. Even though O'odhams have contributed over $1,000,000.00 to the museum. We don't complain, atleast our ways are being shared right? And it's nice to take children to the museum and see their little eyes light up when they see things that reminds them of home. And the Boarding School Exhibit opens MANY eyes to the history that existed just a few blocks north. This slices through me and I'm so grateful this piece of history is no longer being ignored.\n\nLike I said - it's a love/hate relationship. I love the Heard because they give opportunities to Native Artists and share our culture as sensitively as possible. But it's an uphill battle to be deemed good enough to be one of those artists and people who shares our culture. I know of many great people who I personally feel should be \"let in\" be denied and my heart goes out to them. I love that Natives still get in for free but I hate that the Heard treats AZ tribes like we're obligated to help them to keep their lights on. I love that all the tribes in Arizona have been given the oppurtunity to share a piece of their culture yet I hate that the museum focuses on two tribes.\n\nTo my yelpers: Please realize that each tribe has it's own ways and unique culture.

It's much better and more informative. After you finish his, then read mine. Ok? It's because I'm going by memory from 4 years ago and David B. lives in Phoenix and has just been there.\n\nI was born in Scottsdale, went to school in Phoenix and go to Giant's/A's/Angel's/Padre's/Brewer's/Mariner's and now the Dodger's for Spring Training. The desert is in my blood with all of the red sandstone rocks, cactus, roadrunners, and bluebelly lizards. As a child, I would go out and collect boys things... like snakes, crawdads, eggs, aquamarines, agates, spiders, then bring them home to an unhappy Mother. But I also went to school with actual Native-American kids who would wear their cool native clothes and so I got hooked on everything-Indian. Plus, we would go on amazing school field-trips to the local museums. Yea, for getting out of school...\n\nThe Heard is known as the other major Phoenix destination besides the Phoenix Arts Museum but I personally feel it is much better. It is world-class in its exhibits of Native American artifacts, such as pottery, katsina dolls, sand paintings, rugs, baskets, textiles, jewelry, blankets, it's all here. If you love American history, especially Indian, you have to come here and soak it all in. \n\nThe founders, Dwight and Maie Bartlett, loved their Southwest and therefore collected as much as they could afford, then fulfilled their ultimate dream to share it all with the public in 1929.\n\nMost people don't realize it because not much is taught about them, but our native Indians were so creative and amazing people who had such an artist's heart and desire to express themselves and the Heard really shows their work off to the highest degree. There are 39,000 items of cultural and fine art, including drawings, painting and sculpture. Of all of the possibilities to see when you visit, the core of the collection includes 500 simply incredible Hopi katsini dolls that were on loan from the exclusive Goldwater and Harvey Companies. Ritualistic, religious, complex and often hidden meanings are withheld in each individual katsini and I love them for their mystery. Another exhibit that I love because I am just a big kid is the full-sized Navajo Hogan, the Hopi piki room, the Yaqui ramada and the Pueblo oven. Maybe someday I can sneak in and stay over night.\n\nSo, in summary, if you ever visit Phoenix, you have to go to both the Heard and the PAM plus the Taliesin West (I always spell that wrong) building by Frank Lloyd Wright.

We had an excellent tour guide who was part Navajo and part Hopi. In addition to giving us a broad overview of Native American history, he also gave us many insights into growing up on a reservation and cultural traditions. As we toured through the galleries filled with basketry, ceramics, and Navajo blankets, he explained that a lot of the names \"given\" to the tribes by white settlers were simply the result of the two groups not understanding one another. For instance, the Pima tribe is so called because in response to the question, \"What are you called?\" the people answered, \"Pima,\" which means \"I don't know\"--as in, I don't know what you crazy people are asking me!\n\nMy friend and I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend visiting if you're ever in Phoenix.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg"}

Well cancel your flight to NYC for the Smithsonian because believe it or not, we have some cultural options right here in the desert's playground. \n\nI went to the Heard Museum many a day when I was a little girl visiting Phoenix (a much less populated city at the time). From the crafts to the history, the Heard Museum entertained even an 8 year old who really just wanted to play in the pool all day long. Fast forward a \"couple\" of years and I decided it was time to give this historical haven the grownup test. My friends, I was more than impressed. You know how sometimes you visit someplace as a kid and then you go back as an adult and everything seems smaller and just cheaper looking? Don't worry about this being the case with the Heard Museum. They have done a fabulous job of keeping the museum up-to-date, clean and full of great ways for all ages to learn about the Native American culture in Arizona. \n\nSome highlights include:\n\n1. Interactive. The Heard created great displays with information and an interactive game for children...or children at heart. \n\n2. Visual dessert for the eyes. They don't cheat you on historical artifact exhibits which shows that they have a nice group of donors who are eager to keep the museum alive and visually stimulating. \n\n3. Family-fun for everyone. I saw a brochure marketing family-fun days every Saturday in July. Activities include, interactive games, crafts, live performances, etc. \n\n4. AZ Resident Friendly. The admission price was $12 and I cringed a little, but then as if I was meant to get a little cultured that day, they told me that AZ residents receive free admission every second Sunday of the month. Not a bad way to take care of the residents melting in the heat! \n\n5. Cafe food you actually want to eat. To make the most of the day, I ate at the cafe and took advantage of the 85 degree weather while it still lasted. The food...was good. I had a warm turkey and brie sandwich on homemade cranberry bread with the corn pasta salad. Just writing that down made me hungry and want to go back for more. \n\nSo now that I've spread the good word on the Heard, it's time to check it out for yourself.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg"}

When you fully explore every part of the museum I felt it was worthwhile.\n\nI don't profess to be an expert on Native American history (save Geronimo) so if your knowledge is a bit lacking in this area then this is the place to help fill in the gaps. It was definitely a lot of learning for one day but enjoyable and eye-opening at the same time.\n\nThe mock school area of how native americans were forced to integrate was probably the most fascinating part for me. As much as the fact that it was only a few decades ago that the school closed. You usually think of this in the Wild West over a hundred years ago.\n\nIt's a good half day to explore the museum at a fair clip and probably a full one if you stopped to inspect and read every exhibit.\n\nVery enjoyable.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg"}

The museum looks very small from the outside, but it sure manages to open up and cram a lot into the space on both of its floors.  I highly recommend checking out the current Geronimo exhibit.  Thanks to Hollywood (which I should know better than to trust for an accurate portrayals of american indians), I always thought he was an apache hero.  Turns out most apache don't like him.\n\nOutside of a history text book, native american culture can be difficult to study.  It also doesn't help that most presentations of american indian history just make me feel guilty about what our government did to their ancestors decades and centuries before my family even immigrated to the country.  While the Herd Museum doesn't completely avoid this feeling, it does try its best not to shove it in your face.\n\nThe $15 dollar admission isn't too bad.  Free parking was an unexpected treat.  There are also discounts for seniors, children and students.  Native americans can get in for free, but I think I only remember seeing one native american (an employee) the entire time I was there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg"}

One of the contemporary exhibits is a glass sculpture that is created to mimic a traditional Southwestern fence made of ocotillo branches. The museum grounds are beautiful and rather extensive. In the courtyard, you can enjoy an excellent lunch at the museum's cafe while listening to the soothing sounds of the museum's main water feature. I do think that the Native American crafts on sale in the gift shop are a little overpriced, as I have seen similar items of the same high quality sold elsewhere for less.

So yesterday I braved the Metro from Mesa and went to the Heard Museum, and I'm glad I did.  It is a beautiful facility and the exhibits are well-done with lots of explanations and information.\n\nTwo or three gripes:  first, the docents (female) who were giving tours on Monday, 2/25/13, couldn't speak loud enough for the group to hear.  They need to provide some sort of microphone system for the docents to speak to their tours; they are available.  The first docent who, I discovered later, is new and still in training, had a problem with her speed.  She would start explaining about a particular room or exhibit before the entire group was within hearing distance--and about the time the last people came near enough to hear her, she was off to the next exhibit.  \n\nPhotography is allowed in the museum; however, some of the exhibits and explanatory walls are covered with a reflective glass or plex which reflects the light from behind, making photography difficult.\n\nThe prices in the sit-down restaurant are very very very expensive - They are quite appropriate for a dinner, but for a lunch at a venue which is pricey to enter in the first place, an overpriced sandwich isn't appropriate.  Even the hot dog combo in the cantina was $7!  Why does every facility of this type add to the cost of the enjoyment of the place by offering overpriced food?\n\nThe building and grounds are gorgeous, and quite an oasis in the middle of a busy city.  Getting there is a breeze on the Metro, with the stop just across the street.  \n\nI enjoyed my day at Heard, but I probably won't be back.

Thanks Danny! \n\nI am so glad that I went. I love museums, and admittedly have always been interested in Native American history and art.\n\nI think that my favorite part was that 30 foot glass and clay art fence right near the entrance. It was stunning and I think I stared at it like I was in a stoned out trance for a while lol.\n\nI think the story behind it is very cool as well. It starts out brown, to symbolize the fact that we are dead and below the earth. Later on it moves into more earthy orangey colors to symbolize that we are on the earth. Then it moves into mostly blue glass which symbolizes the spirit world.\n\nI also thought the ginormous collection of Katsina dolls were pretty amazing.\n\nMy buddies and I also spent a lot of time in the room with the giant mural.

I kid I kid, I think the most interesting thing that I learned was the ceremonial things the Apaches did when a girl starts menstruating.\n\nI was blown away by the idea of men having so much respect for women, even seeing them as sacred!

I ended up going on a Tuesday, so I just paid the full price admission of $16. I figured, hey...why not! I'm not going to be here again for awhile.\n\nI learned so much about the lifestyle of all the different Native American reservations in Arizona and across the US. From the Navajo to the Hopi tribes, the pottery they make to the garments they wore, the Heard Museum was a mind-blasting educational experience! There was definitely too much information for me to absorb in one day, which is why I would go back again if I were ever in Phoenix.\n\nThe gift shop is pricey! I wanted to buy a souvenir, perhaps a piece of unique jewelry, but all the ones that caught my eye were in the $200+ range. Regardless, the knowledge I gained walking out of the museum was priceless!\n\nThe most disturbing moment for me was learning about how these Native Americans were pushed out of their lands and forced to live as \"civilized\" beings. This particular exhibit is located on their 2nd floor and did a great job in making me feel uncomfortable. \n\nThey endured torture and were forced to lose their long hair, their traditional clothing, their identity...denied the right to be who they are. Sound familiar? Sound like the racism slaves endured in the South? Well, nothing I read or hear will ever allow me to fully understand what these individuals dealt with, and probably still deal with, but knowing and understanding that this exists only makes me love the strength of the Native Americans.\n\nAll I can learn are what the pages of textbooks taught us in history class, but now that I am out of school, a museum has a way of retelling stories of the past on a whole other level. \n\nThe best part was connecting the dots about Arizona. I went to the Grand Canyon prior to my excursion in Phoenix, and I realized that a lot of the different locations in the Grand Canyon are named after these Native American tribes. \n\nI love me some education! ;)", "type": "review", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg"}

I have gone twice and have left extremely impressed both times.  The atmosphere is so amazing.  Right away, just walking through the courtyard to the main entrance, there's so much beauty to take in.  You'll walk past the courtyard cafe, cantina, bookstore, and gift shop on the way to the main entrance.  Both times I've gone, I did the museum first and then the shops and cafe afterwards.  \n\nThe entire museum is somewhat of a maze and, if you're not on a guided tour, can be pretty confusing to navigate.  We didn't have a tour guide either time -- they're free and on a regular schedule, but we preferred to wander at our own pace.  The first floor is very large and divided up into sections.  There's a lot of baskets, pottery, and katsina dolls to check out, and some really interesting native american history to take in.  I learned a lot about the local and native history.  The first floor (to me) gets boring kind of quickly.  A lot of the collections are not as old or historic as I had expected.  It seems like the younger visitors enjoyed the first level more than I did.\n\nThe most impressive part of the museum for me was the 2nd level.  I was in complete awe of the Indian Boarding School exhibit.  I learned SO much about the Indian Schools that I had never even heard of before.  I really wish they would have taught us about this experience when I was in school.  It was AMAZING.  \n\nOverall, the museum experience was very good.  We learned a lot and really enjoyed the history, art, and culture.  The only thing I don't like about the museum is navigating through it.  They do give you maps and offer guided tours, but it's fairly difficult to navigate if you don't know where you're going.  I don't like to look at maps, I prefer to wander.  Different areas are not very clearly marked.  You'll see a door in a hallway and wonder what it leads to, then walk through and realize you're entering a completely different part of the museum.  It's kind of hard to explain, but I wish the areas were more clearly marked.  It's not really big enough to get lost in, but we definitely had several occurrences where we weren't really sure where we were or where we were headed.\n\nThe 2nd time I visited, we decided to have lunch at the cafe and we were really impressed.  The service was great and the prices were MUCH more reasonable than we had expected.  We figured it would be pricey, but it was not.  I had the smoked salmon quesadilla and it was outstanding.  \n\nThe museum shop is pretty typical from what I've experienced at other museums -- a few knick-knacks that are in my price range, surrounded by ridiculously high priced pieces of art/pottery/dolls/rugs.  It's REALLY neat to look at but I couldn't imagine buying anything other than a magnet or a coffee mug.  Some of the pieces are thousands of dollars, but it's awesome to just look and admire.\n\nOverall, always a great experience, easy to find (there's a light rail stop right out front), and it's also very close to other touristy places if you're visiting and want to experience Phoenix.  I highly recommend this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg"}

Kinda sucked. And the food was COLD. I met the craziest pagaent moms. One lady, in fun, even told me to \"talk to the hand\". I kid you not. Oh. Parking you ask?  Across the street. I think we spent five bucks. I would most definitely return to the Herberger. I will remember to bring my own cookies and to ask how long the show will be.

The majority of the laughs were in the first half of the play, but as a whole very amusing, entertaining, great performances and solid writing. It made for a fun start to our Saturday night.\n\nLike most theaters, symphony halls, performance centers, etc., they serve coffee, beer, wine and a few select liquors, which must be consumed before entering the actual theater. Likewise, I love the fact that one can purchase drinks (wine for us) for the intermission and the drinks will be poured and waiting for you without standing in line again. Bonus, considering the intermission may be your only opportunity for a restroom break.\n\nThe chairs are very comfortable within the theater and there really is not a bad seat in the house, considering it is a very small theater. I have two complaints, though, which are totally fixable in which case I would easily rank this theater 5 stars...\n\n1) The temperature was very pleasant outside, between say 60 and 65 degrees. Inside, however, we were sweating. It wasn't a dripping sweat but if you choose to \"dress up\" to go to the theater, you might be uncomfortable, as we were.\n\n2) My second complaint is about the website and the frustration in navigating around to find seating charts that don't suck. Right now it's a crappy, what they consider, 3D seating chart that when clicked on will show you the available seats. The problem is, it doesn't work very well. It's just not clear. It's sad when you google seating charts for the theater and ticket brokers have a better seating diagram than the theater itself. So do yourself a favor and do what I did, find a good seating chart and call the box office. It's quicker and you know exactly what you're getting.\n\nMy thoughts on the best seats....the floor seats seem to be good and close. But I chose mezzanine  because I like the looking-down view. If you do choose one of the balconies, I recommend in front of the stage and the 1st row. If you sit on either side of the stage, you'll inevitably end up leaning forward in your seat and resting your elbows on the ledge in front of you to get the best view, doesn't seem that comfy. And I say front row because we sat center stage on the second row and my friend had a hard time seeing over or around the big hair in front of her. Just saying.\n\nGreat experience overall. Small venue, has a laid back feel to it with some folks choosing to dress to the 9's while others were comfortably wearing jeans. I'll be keeping my eye out for other plays that might interest me, as I will certainly return to this theater.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RA2EuX04SHqmayKpLhpNvA"}

Seriously. All you people that love those huge grandiose things need to experience the intimacy and power that comes with a small theater, and a nice one on top of that. \n\nThe Herberger is in a great location and is a great venue to see a show. The staff is always really friendly and the space is always clean. It has class without being too stale and old. Like downtown hipster class. It's nice. Soothing. Fun. Good for all ages. \n\nThe bar inside also has a window for the outside patio which is great for nice evenings and intermissions :) Also, if you're lucky you will see some musical troubadours outside as well.\n\nOne awesome thing is that you can get parking validated for the Arizona Center for $3. You park there, take your ticket, then go to the Herberger box office and get a validation ticket. When you exit the Arizona Center, enter the ticket you got when you parked and then the validation one.\n\nSo now you have no more excuses not to go (if the light rail didn't help already).\n\nSee you there!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "RA2EuX04SHqmayKpLhpNvA"}

Herberger has been doing it for years and I swear I am going to do this regularly, and I don't even work downtown.\n\nIf you are on lunchbreak you may need to extend your lunch break a little just for commute or parking.    \n\nYou were probably going to spend $12 on lunch anyway, you may as well stop by a world class theatre watch a witty show with what seem to be professional actors for 45 minutes.  \n\nThe shows run for about 2 weeks and then there is 2 week break, then a new show runs for another two weeks, throughout the season.  \n\nSCHEDULE:\nhttp://www.herbergertheater.org/lunch_time_theater\n\nJoin the mailing list.

The lighting was fantastic-- the subtleties were not lost on me as the scenes progressed from comedic to utter sadness, and I could almost FEEL the sunshine coming through the large windows whenever scenes from Lock Willow played out, and the cold winter air surrounding Jerusha's dorm that winter as she wrote to her \"Daddy.\"  The ushers were very friendly and eager to help those who needed it, the cookies looked wonderful by the bar, and the women's restroom was tidy.\n\nNow, if we could only get HT to emphasize in many places that it offers $3 parking validation...  \n---\nI thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific performance of \"Daddy Long Legs,\" ATC's first musical production at The Herberger Theater tonight!  The two-actor (Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock) musical, plus the invisible, but great assets, the orchestra and sound crew, entertained and amazed me w/ their execution of a well-written body of work.  It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... what's not to like?  Truly enjoyed McGinnis' impeccable timing, as well.  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- what's easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when you're NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?  However, when you do decide to place the financial investment, you will almost always be rewarded w/ a highly-memorable night, believe you me!  \n\nI had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend \"Daddy Long Legs\" to anyone who enjoys great acting and music!

When I was there they had an average of about 400 students from 6-12th grade.\n\nMorning classes (7:45am - 12:15pm) are normal academics. Performing arts are in the afternoon till 2-3pm depending on the classes. \n\nFor middle school:\nPiano is a required class during the morning.\nPerforming arts options are voice & an instrument (this includes strings I believe), OR ballet (offered off campus with transportation by the school).\nGuitar is available after 6th grade.\nJazz band & percussion ensemble is available by audition only after 6th grade.\nDrama is more of an after school program & has a fee. \n\nFor high school:\nStudents choose 2-3 classes from music (instrument, voice or piano), OR drama, OR ballet.\n\nTo get in there was a waiting list. Or was it first come first serve? Either way, be sure to put your kids name down or be there when they first open with all the necessary paper work. The slots are limited. Remember, the school is SMALL!\n\nI hear they are trying to remodel & expand. When I went there the school rented space from the church, but is in no way affiliated religiously. Other space was across the street. Yes, you cross the street back & forth to get from 1 class to the next. They even had the rule, \"No hugging in the crosswalk.\" That says something about the students lol\n\nConcerts were held in Pilgrim Hall or the actual church. Pilgrim Hall is where lunch can be eaten or a band class is held in the afternoon. Other students eat in the courtyard. A lunch truck (roach coach) came so students could purchase a lunch if they didn't bring their own.\n\nThis school had a high turn over of teachers. Every year about 25% of the faculty would either be fired or quit. That's actually a lot of teachers. This may not be the case anymore since the school officials have changed. There are teachers still teaching that I recognize from when I went there:\n- Leah Fregulia-Roberts (Head of School) used to be the pricipal\n- Brian Hawkins (11th & 12th Grade Math)\n- Kyle Kirkman (7th & 8th Grade Math) taught me\n- Diane Legge (5th Grade Piano) taught me piano when there was no 5th grade\n- Kristin Mailhiot (Vice-Principal) used to be a middle school science teacher\n\nStudents who either go to this school during HS or graduate stay involved. I would know, I'm friends with a lot of them on Facebook. They stay arts oriented a lot of the time & still talk about things currently going on at ASA.\n\nSo, why did I leave? There are a few reasons.\n- I wanted a big HS experience.\n- I wanted to go to school with more than 400 students.\n- I wanted life lessons. I didn't want to be sheltered. I wanted to see how the real world worked.\n- I wanted to go to a school where there was more than 2 guys to every 10 girls. And where those guys weren't gay. Nothing wrong with being gay. But I like boys, gay boys aren't interested in girls. See where I'm going with this?\n- I wanted to get away from the 5 hours of homework every night. I was constantly exhausted. I was 11, 12, & 13. I was still a kid. I missed my time to play... & sleep.\n- I wanted to get away from teachers who taught opinions instead of facts. Yes, this happened. Yes, I told him he was wrong for doing so. Yes, he hated me for it.\n- I hated playing an instrument. I didn't have time to practice after all that homework. I can't sing. Anything I was interested in wasn't available till a later year.

I work in Education and I talk to Teachers, Curriculum Directors, and Principals from all over the West Coast.  And,I am married to a former teacher at ASA.  I am passionate about this school.\n\nI will admit, I was suspect. I thought the parents who were so ecstic over the education offered at ASA might be a little off.  It couldn't be that good.  Really?  \n\nMy son started school with all the aprehensions of a 5th Grade student who knew very little about music, was active in sports and was very sad about leaving his friends behind.  We (even he) chose this school because they had a strong emphasis on education and we expected the school to offer my son the opportunity to learn in an environment that was strict, supportive and creative.  \n\nWe were not disappointed. ASA was all that - and MORE! The academic teachers are inventive, collaborative, and very supportive.  The arts teachers are music professionals and perform with and for the students and move them along in the curriculum with such finesse it's like they have private music lessons every day.\n\nAnd, the year was a success.  My son was delighted with all his classes, especially his music classes with Monica Sauer Anthony.  What a surprise to find him begging us to play his clarinet every evening before we had dinner or before we participted in a famly event.  \n\nHe loved the Science Curriculum, the hands-on activity and his teacher's passion  for education.  He worked hard in Language Arts and Social Studies and really showed off his new found maturity and knowledge during Presentation Week.  And the lessons he learned in Life Skills class were really applicable and life changing.\n\nThen the performances at the end of the year were very remarkable and telling. I saw kids excelling in their musical expertise and showing off this success with such poise and confidence that I couldn't believe these were the same kids I met just 10 months prior at our summer welcome parties.\n\nThe school does have a rigorous application process that leaves you on edge just wondering if your son or daughter will be permitted entry into this prestigious, blue ribbon school.  The school doesn't tolerate any bullying and supports all types of students. And, the school is near Downtown Phoenix, so there are issues with the campus being spread across some streets, but those are being addressed quickly as they are building and expanding into new facilities that will offer a number of benefits for the ever-growing school.\n\nThis school is really a dream.  It's an educational opportunity I would recommend to any parent.  I think my son would write a similiar recommendation!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z9GH9bo8SHKx3oOokhHLyw"}

However I can't complain too much when one of them is tuned to Sportscenter which is all I really need as I eat my lunch. My major complaint about Majerle's is that it is a very awkward space. There is a hostess stand out front on the sidewalk but no one is ever there, so you have to walk in and then BAM you are like on top of the bar. So you're in the way while waiting for a hostess which I hate.\n\nOther than that main complaint, I'm not going to hate too much on the food. It's a freaking sports bar. They serve sports bar food. I am not expecting five star cuisine...I just fried goodness that will clog up my ateries and beer on tap. If they have a salad or two so I can feel better about myself, great. For the most part everything I have tried has been good, including the potato skins, grilled chicken caesar wrap, fried chicken salad, kids grilled cheese meal (hey I wasn't hungry that day!) and the house salad. The french fries are really good especially dipped in ranch. The only thing I didn't really like that I have tried has been the chicken tenders. Something about them was just a bit off to me.

It started off with a tiny girl singing Gin and Juice by Snoop Dogg.  Then came the Beastie Boys and Salt N Pepa.  And that was enough, I was hooked!\n\nIn the business of full disclosure, I don't think it's advertised as Hip Hop Karaoke, I think it's just referred to as karaoke.  That's just what it's become known as between me and my friends because that's all we've ever heard/sang there.  Which is awesome if you've never experienced it.\n\nDan Majerle and a few of the Suns rolled there after the game too which was kind of cool, added another fun dynamic to the drunken sing a long.\n\nDidn't have a bite of food so I can't comment on that.  But I did have a hell of a time and next time I can stay out late on a Tuesday (not nearly as often as I'd like) I will definitely be back!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ"}

I was hanging out at home when I got the call to hang out with this guy for a low key night.  I had to remind him it was Monday Night Football and the NLDS game of Phillies v. Rockies.  So he suggests we hit up Majerle's, which I'm down for because it means more sport watching and less talking.\n\nSo I find my way down here, and say screw it to paying for parking.  After the whole $20 to park at Westgate, I'm down to take my chances at getting a parking ticket.  It's ridiculous how much the city makes off of parking, parking tickets, and the ever illustrious DUIs.\n\nAnyways, I go into Majerle's, completely ignored by the hostess out front.  Glad to know she's getting paid $8.50 to not talk to anyone and act pretty...  Settle down at the bar and order a Blue Moon, because it's a Monday, it's football, it's baseball, and I'm preparing for another laborious date.\n\nHalfway through my beer my date arrives.  Which wouldn't be cool, but I need to get good and drunk so I deal.  He automatically decides we need to get wings.  Thanks for deciding...because I have no thoughts of my own.  Apparently him being a gentleman meant he would talk shit on the wings I wanted, then reluctantly give in to getting the boneless buffalo wings.  Which are $5 along with four other appetizers during their 4-8 pm happy hour.  Good deal there!\n\nThe wings come out within 15 minutes or so and they look...odd.  It looks like someone sliced tofu and lightly fried them, then dipped them in excessive amounts of sauce.  Definitely not the most appetizing item to look at.  I wished they looked better, because then I wouldn't have the hippie making fun of me the whole time.  They tasted okay, but the look alone was too much of a turn off to enjoy.\n\nThe bartender disappeared after we ordered the wings, so we spent some time waiting for her to discover us again so we could order our entree.  Oh how I wished she had taken our order earlier.  I had to listen to the douche hippie talk smack on the Angels and how people die all the time so Adenhart's death didn't matter.  Yeah...that deserved a total smack in the face.  Or complete beat down.  Don't ever hate of my Angels or commit blasphemy against Adenhart.  I will not stand for that, especially if I've had a few drinks in me.\n\nAnyways, so I eventually order the veggie wrap with chicken and he gets the chicken parmesan.  Not too much time passes, so I could enjoy the flat screens and watch the Dolphins show Mark Sanchez how to play a real football game.  The wrap comes, and it's huge!  I enjoyed the fruit salad of pineapple and grapes.  And the actually spinach tortilla and veggies were good, but the chicken just dragged the wrap down.  It was so bland and tasteless.  I wish I would have just gone pure veggie.\n\nI had a couple rounds of beer after that, just to pass the time until the Dolphins could be declared the official winners.  Conversation came and went with the people at the bar, far more interesting than the person I was with.  The beers came and went, and soon it was time to peace out.  When I saw the tab, I was glad I didn't have to pay.  $60+ to \"enjoy\" conversation with a tool and overpriced food and drinks.

I really covet being wowed, I like being pleasantly surprised, and I can have a perfectly merry day with a run of the mill meal. Unfortunately, there are some experiences that don't fit in to any of my \"I will return again and again or at least recommend to friends\" template.\n \n Majerle's is one of those experiences.\n\nI know that I should definitely give this place another try but only because I had such a bad time I think that it must have been entirely abnormal because it would be out of business if it was run this way daily.\n When I arrived on Sunday afternoon (right as the Cardinals game was about to start), there were several content tables already enjoying their beer and bar fare. I must say that the food wasn't terrible. I wouldn't classify it as anything special or something that I would crave on any particular day. But the wings were crisp, the salad was fresh'ish' and the burger was prepared to the temp I ordered. This is where the one star came from. Decent food (good temp, tastes like what it's supposed to, sans hair, ect) deserves some credit.\n \n   If I could give negative stars for service, this would be a -5 Stars type of place. Our server was either hung over or was just entirely uninterested in doing ANYTHING that her job description calls for. She greeted us about ten minutes after we sat down (although it was a Cardinals game day, the bar was probably about half full). She took our drink order and returned with our drinks ages later (well, another almost ten minutes). I was starving and ready to order food but wasn't able to because she slammed the drinks on the table and left again. I flagged down another server and he was so kind as to send ours back. FINALLY I ordered. Again, the food was fine. It wasn't, however, fine enough to cancel out the fact that our appetizer was delivered 20 minutes laster followed IMMEDIATELY by our entree's. Ok. Fine. But, the salad was wrong the first time (Note: When your guests are ordering, it helps to listen to what they actually want. It is NOT a good practice to forget and then just 'guess' what they said). And our server didn't even deliver our food so we couldn't order another drink until we flagged her down again. We ordered another two beers and waited. And waited. And waited. I saw our beers sitting on the bar and our server chatting in the corner to another associate. We couldn't get her attention so my dining companion/boyfriend went to the bar himself to get them. In fact, we didn't see our server again for the rest of the meal. I was so irate at this point that I wanted to leave immediately and spend our Sunday afternoon football watching/beer drinking pennies elsewhere. I flagged down the same server I asked to find my server the first time and had him do my bidding again (he seemed to be working, why couldn't I have sat in HIS section?) She came over, mumbled some apology about having to get our own beers and dropped our check. \n  Bright points: They have a great tv set up for football watching. Multiple tv's tuned to every single game you could imagine. \nNot so Bright Points: For me, watching football at a sports bar has necessary accoutrements (steady flow of beer, timely delivery of food, ect) to make it enjoyable. This mark was completely missed due entirely to the complete disregard our server had for her job. Or her guests.\nDownright Dim points: Well, this review pretty much sums it up.\n If I'm in the area and kind of desperate, perhaps I'll try it again. Probably Not.", "type": "review", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ"}

With the shot it came out to $12. So much for drink specials. They ordered another drink special in hopes it would be better. Fail. Sad to say but they returned it. Stick with beer. You can't go wrong with the flavor and amount of alcohol in it", "type": "review", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ"}

First of all, it was July and for people like us who live in Arizona, the heat is here to stay and we learn to deal with it. However, for visitors from all around, the 110 degree weather means that they will not eat outside. So we had the choice to wait for an indoor table or take the patio seating that had immediate seating -- and I mean, every seat was available on the patio. The hostess looked at us like we were crazy as we took the patio and we proceeded to order food. Now, contrary to common belief, just because a sports bar is named after an athlete, doesn't mean that athlete frequents there every day. But on this particular day, Dan Marjele happened to walk into Marjeles. The irony cracked us up because we knew that the out of towners probably assumed this is a regular occurrence. And hey, maybe it is! \n\nAnyway, this is the perfect bar to grab a quick and decent bite to eat before a sporting event downtown. The buffalo chicken is delicious, as is the Chicken Teriyaki sandwich and any other wrap on the menu. It's one or two notches above generic bar food and the drinks also flow nicely. They have plenty of TVs inside so even if you don't go to the game, it's still a fun atmosphere to sit and watch the game on the TV. \n\nI wouldn't drive to Downtown Phoenix just to visit Marjeles, but this is definitely one of my choices when I'm looking for a sports bar before or after the game in Downtown Phoenix.", "type": "review", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ"}

It's great for post-game festivities after leaving the stadiums. And it's great for just watching any game with friends on any of the multiple HD TVs.\n\nMajerle's has plenty of beers on tap, a solid HH menu, and serves libations until around 2am every night. It also seems like it's a bonafide occupational qualification to be hot to work here, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. \n\nMajerle's is not great with food, however. They shell out the typical pedestrian bar fare, which is highly suitable for the typical Diamondbacks fan, but if your taste buds yearn for something more refined, you're much better off grabbing food at Networks Bar and Grill or The Arrogant Butcher down the street. \n\nIn conclusion, Majerle's is the slam dunk watering hole in downtown on a game night.

The sauce is not Frank's and Butter, but it was a reasonable facsimile: a little hot, a little vinegary.  We asked for them to be cooked crispy and they did, but I can't confirm if that's how they would come if you don't ask.\n\nThe rest of our meal was tasty, quick and as ordered as it has been every other time we've eaten here.

I would recommend this spot to anyone (out of town or not) as a nice place to cool off and relax during the weekend.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_yfprBETaYgySkKyl8ZWMQ"}

I'm a sucker for ghost stories, I'll admit it. \n\nWhen the boy and I decided to a day of wandering around Phoenix before making our way out to the Grand Canyon for a wedding, we had a hotel choice to make. There's a number of offerings downtown, and in August, let's face it,  not a whole lot of people are visiting this 107-degree town so the options in our budget range were pretty open. \n\nWhat got us to bypass the fancier, but on sale, hotels with their shiny lobbies, fake-scent-pumping ventilation systems and flat screen TVs? The idea that we might wake up to a bump in the night. \n\nAs the story goes, in 1928,  a woman, desperately in love  (and possibly preggers) with a bell boy from a neighboring hotel, took a flying leap from the roof and became a part of the hotel's history. Supposedly the room in which she stayed, 720, is still alive with her presence, as she plays with the TV and glides in shadows across the room. \n\nWe did a little ghost hunting while we stayed, though  Room 720 wasn't \navailable, we were still able to wander the 7th floor and take pictures of the hallways and stairs. Alas, there was no ghost sightings. \n\nNor did we hear the giggles of children who spent their days as students here when an Indian school occupied the property. \n\nHowever, the hotel was still fun, it was like taking a step back in time with pedestal sinks and mosaic floors. And who doesn't like a bottle opener in the bathroom? It was easy to imagine the silver screen movies stars partying until the early hours, even in our no-view room. \n\nIf you're here, make a stop at the pool, where Marilyn Monroe once swam. It's beautiful at night adorned with multi-colored bubble lamps. But you can't swim after 10! (Who's looking ;-P )", "type": "review", "business_id": "_yfprBETaYgySkKyl8ZWMQ"}

Hotel San Carlos had sweet rates, so this was the spot. \n\nBefore coming here I knew nothing about the history of it.. so I wasn't in it for the ghosts, although my wallet went missing, so could it be the spirit of Leone Jensen that was to blame? I will never know. I ended up getting the King Suite, for the same price as a regular room. Blame it on my abilities to get whatever the hell I want is up to you, but the guy at the front desk was more than happy to upgrade. Score.\n\nOnce inside the room, I was taken aback by the beautiful crown molding, Victorian decor, original radiators heating the room, vintage bed canopy and of course, the antiques that were scattered about. It reminded me of one of my old apartments in Boston, plenty of history to give me that sweet sweet feeling of being back in New England. This was what I dug most. I am not sure how big a normal room is, but the King Suite was pretty spacious. A loaded bar, with stools and all, living room area with a pull out couch, tv and footrests,  an armoir for hanging my clothes, which I didn't use obviously..  I snooped through every nook because it was all so old and interesting and mostly because im nosey. The bed was friggin' huge.. assuming they named the room after the bed would not be totally out of the question. \n\nHere come the complaints...\nThe pillows.. my god, they were so hard and gigantic (that's what she said). I ended up having to use a throw pillow from the couch to rest my head comfortably for I am a small human being with a tiny neck. The bathroom entrance has a step up that is about 10\" high which I am surprised I did not stumble over and fall face first into the toilet followed by a broken nose and bleeding knees in the middle of the night. And lastly, had I of slept in 10 minutes more than I did, I would have been awoken by the sound of the maids vacuuming through the paper thin walls.. There is very little privacy in that sense. \n\nOther than that, the staff were so nice, and it was decorated beautifully for the holiday season. I hear the pool is rad, and how can it not be when Marilyn Monroe herself took a dip in it once upon a time? Other celebs have shacked up here as well.. Mae West, Jack Dempsey, John F. Kennedy and one of my faves..  Clark Gable. How cool is that! \n\nCome to think of it.. I did hear the sound of little children talking and laughing as I was leaving that morning, which I blamed on something outside not knowing the story about it being built on the first schoolhouse in Phx and over some sacred wishing well? Maybe I did experience a little paranormal activity, without even knowing it!\n\nI will certainly be back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "_yfprBETaYgySkKyl8ZWMQ"}

While the hotel has a lounge, it's dimly lit and looks like a run down lounge, rather than an upscale destination. \n\nOn St. Patrick's Day, both the lounge and the Irish bar next door throw a big St. Patty's Day party. If you're there for important business, it's not really where you should be staying. If you're there for a sports trip to go to a Suns or Diamondbacks game with a bunch of guys, then it's fine.\n\nThe wireless signal in room 607 was non-existent most of the time, unless you positioned yourself near the window or in a very specific spot on the bed.\n\nThe first night I brought my MacBook Pro down to the lobby to see if I could get a signal. While I could get a signal, there was no where to sit and plug-in, so that option was out. I went over to the brand new Westin Hotel across the street and used the free wi-fi in the lobby lounge. Truth be told, I'd rather have stayed at the Westin, but I was trying to save the company a few dollars. That's a decision I will think twice about in the future.\n\nThe second night, frustrated, I called downstairs to the desk and the woman told me that I should bring my laptop downstairs to see if I could connect, then go back upstairs. What she didn't know is that I've been in the Internet industry for 16-years. When I pleaded to switch rooms, she continued to try and tell me to come downstairs, even though I'd already tried that the night before. When I insisted that she find me another room, she told me the hotel was overbooked. She also started down the road of blaming the customer, saying \"why are you yelling at me?\" I said, I am not yelling at you, I am frustrated because your hotel advertises free wi-fi, now you're telling me I have to come downstairs (which I did the night before) and try to connect, then go back upstairs.\n\nAfter that call, I took my laptop over to the Sheraton, another Starwood Hotel, which is a bit longer of a walk, but it was nice out. I sat in the lobby on their free wi-fi while watching a bit of March Madness on the big screen and enjoying snacks from their convenience shop.\n\nIf you need a wi-fi connection, then stay far far away from this hotel.\n\nNow to the roach. So, I went to take a shower the morning of my departure and found our not so little friend in the bathtub. Gross. I called down and that sent a bell man up to check it out, but it had scurried somewhere by the time he arrived. I took a very quick shower (which took some time to warm, maybe because of the age of the hotel and it's old water system), checked out, and will never go back.\n\nSorry Hotel San Carlos. While you are a charming little old hotel, you're not for me. I can't recommend you.\n\nI will say that the only benefit to this hotel is the barber shop on the ground floor. They were really nice I got a great haircut, but it was $18. And, the hotel is directly on the path of the light rail from the airport, so it's pretty easy to get to. Although the Westin is now right there too, so I'd prefer to stay at the new Westin in the future, given it's proximity to ASU Cronkite School.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_yfprBETaYgySkKyl8ZWMQ"}

It appears that he recently purchased the lounge/bar.  He has a great personality and attitude.  I wish him the best.\nThe hotel is known for it's haunted nature.  I was not pleased to hear this.  Some may be attracted by this.  My over active mind kept me thinking of ghosts in the middle of the night. That's just my fault. \nOverall, a historic hotel with a lot of personality.

That's the problem. It's just old and crappy, not historic and charming. There is a difference. Maybe it would have been more charming if the staff knew what they were doing. Not a single basic question I asked could be answered by the girl working at the front desk. The vallet guy was NEVER around. NEVER. So that made it a little hard to, you know, vallet my car.

She offered us a good deal compared to their normal pricing but we were all a little tight on funds so we were nervous about upgrading. She asked the manager to come over and after chatting with all of us for a few minutes (she was so super sweet and informative about the history of the hotel and an absolute pleasure to speak with) she worked some kind of wonderful magic and brought the room down to a killer deal that was completely mind blowing. All of us were so excited because not only did each of us now have a bed to sleep in, but it was going to save us money so that we had a bit more to spend at the Con. \n\nThe room had a separate living room with a couch bed, desk, chair, and foot stool. The bedroom had 2 full-size beds and a nice desk. The view was of downtown PHX and it had 2 nice-sized closets and 2 bathrooms! This was perfect for 3 girls and 2 guys since we all had to get ready at the same time. \n\nThe hotel is beautiful. The lobby is quaint and well appointed. Obviously being a historical landmark it is older and smaller than the gigantic contemporary resorts that many of us are now used to, but it's so much better in many ways. It was warm and friendly and felt like a loved one's home. Honestly I would stay there again anytime. \n\nThere is talk about it being haunted but I didn't get a scary vibe from the hotel at all. I will say that without knowing anything about the haunting history I did step onto the elevator by myself to go up to my room and all of the sudden I smelled some sort of fruity  perfume smell that was not present when I first got into it and the elevator which was set to go up took me down to the basement even though the B button was not pushed and my room was on the 5th floor. The doors opened revealing the basement and I said \"Hello?\" There was no one around. It kind of creeped me out a little bit later when I found out more about the history of the hotel and it's haunting stories. \n\nI highly recommend the Hotel San Carlos for those of you who appreciate history and don't mind a hotel with character. \n\nOh and the parking isn't awful. It's just a little jot up the street which for those of you who don't mind walking a short ways, is just fine.

No longer functional but still present, there is a knob in each room for refrigerated water - something I'm sure travelers appreciated in decades past.

I mentioned this to the poised woman at the check-in desk who said that next time I should park in the lot at their building where they validated parking. She then brough out a yummy iced tea for me to sip while filling out the new client form. I went to the bathroom, which featured a delightful scented candle, and then Sandy (?) brought me to the changing room and then my chair. A surprise: shortly after sitting down in the barber chair a woman brought me over to have my shampoo--and gave me a brief massage first. The massage/shampoo woman had a very positive energy to her. Marina cut my hair and, although she was not much of a talker, was upbeat and gave me a great cut. I've been looking for a great place in Phoenix and found it.

She spent extra time with me and made sure I was happy.\n\nThe negatives which will most likely make me not go back:\nIt was expensive- once again, I visit Aveda salons frequently and was still shocked when the (unfriendly) receptionist rung me up.\nPartially the reason my ticket was so expensive was because I had 2 products that I was going to purchase. After seeing the bill, I put one back and thought about coming back another day to return the other because I was embarrassed and felt guilty putting both products back.\n\nThis leads me into complaining about how they take EVERY chance at an up sell. Every person who I came into contact with tried with every effort to push products on me. I was shocked and extremely uncomfortable. I have never seen it that bad.

He also touched on the stories of each person (the Marx brothers were done as one set), also giving insight on their individual impacts on our world. \n\nI wish I could remember some of the brilliant lines, but I can only recall \"Albert Einstein is the patron saint of 'What if?'\".

But what impressed us was the friendliness and happiness of the staff that morning. We walked in and were cheerfully greeted by Anita at the front register. She looked around and seeing all the staff was busy, she bussed a table for us and sat us immediately. We were impressed right there. Then we were served by Kamal, who was super friendly, attentive and in a great mood. But it wasn't just the 2 people we had direct contact with. Must have been the Easter spirit or something, but the whole staff seemed to have smiles on their faces while we were there. We kept noticing and commenting to each other how odd it was to see happy restaurant staff (how sad is that?)

I just had some plain ole pancakes with eggs, hash browns and bacon. None of those fancy pancakes, just plain ole buttermilk pancakes lol. My only disappointed was the bacon. Don't get me wrong, it was extra crispy like I had requested but they were the two smallest pieces of bacon I have ever seen. I had to eat them slowly so that I could bask in the yummy flavor that is extra crispy bacon. Oh and the pancakes, YUMMY! They were big and fluffy, just the way I like them.\n\n\nAll in all, not to shabby for a late Saturday night. Especially since all I wanted was pancakes. I was a tad bit colder in there than I would have liked, and it seems as I was not the only one who thought so because quite a few people had to put their jackets or coats back on to eat.

The mole here is so good that I get a little insulted when I see it on menus elsewhere. The chicken is pulled from the bone and seems stewed as it's very tender and juicy. \n\nService is always quick and friendly here. Decor is not the most inspiring here, but in Mexican restaurants I think that is a badge of honor. Folks of my pale pigment may pass on this place because it's location is rather industrial and low rent. That's fine by me, they can go to Macayo's and I'll take my usual booth under the spray painted swordfish.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ"}

Its a bit overpriced at dinner, and the portions are rather large. But I think it would be spot-on for some lunch fare.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ"}

This is a gigantic restaurant located in South Phoenix. \n\nThe Good: The menu is extensive. The salsa they bring with your chips is hot and delicious. Ordered the \"three meat plate\" (for two) and was bombarded by a metal skillet (with it's own built in burner) heaped with a mountain of steak, chicken, pork, jalapenos, and onions. It was a meal for 4! The flavors were exquisite.\n\nThe Bad: The decor is bland, and the lights are brighter than the sun.\n\nThe Ugly: Nothing at all was ugly about the place. The staff and patrons were all very friendly. The bathroom was clean. The place felt safe outside even after dark (they have a security guard posted at the door).", "type": "review", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ"}

My husband loves it- I think it's a bit greasy. La Canasta on 7th St is way, way better.
