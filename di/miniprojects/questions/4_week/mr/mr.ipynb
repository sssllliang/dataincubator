    "Return a list of the top 100 words in article text (in no particular order).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to write this as two map reduces:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first job is similar to standard wordcount but with a few .  The data provided for wikipedia is in in *.xml.bz2 format.  Mrjob will automatically decompress bz2.  We'll deal with the xml in the next question.  For now, just treat it as text.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**A few Hints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To split the words, use the regular expression \"\\w+\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Words are not case sensitive: i.e. \"The\" and \"the\" reference to the same word.  You can use `string.lower()` to get a single case-insenstive canonical version of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second job will take a collection of pairs `(word, count)` and filter for only the highest 100.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To make the job more reusable make the job find the largest `n` words where `n` is a parameter obtained via [`get_jobconf_value`](https://pythonhosted.org/mrjob/utils-compat.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We have to keep track of at most the `n` most popular words.  As long as `n` is small, e.g. 100, we can keep track of the *running largest n* in memory.  Use a [Heap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) [Priority Queue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) structure for this.  It is implemented in python as [heapq](https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html), which is conveniently part of the standard library.  You may be asked about this data structure on an interview so it is good to get practice with it now.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To obtain the largest `n`, we need to first obtain the largest n elements per chunk from the mapper, output them to the same key (reducer), and then collect the largest n elements of those in the reducer (**Question:** why does this gaurantee that we have found the largest n over the entire set?)  Given that we are using a priority queue, we will need to first initialize it, then add it for each record, and then output the top `n` after seeing each record.  For mappers, notice that these three phases correspond nicely to these three functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "      - `mapper_init`\n",
    "      - `mapper`\n",
    "      - `mapper_final`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are similar functions in the reducer.  Also, while the run method to launch the mapreduce job is a class method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "        MRWordCount.run()\n",
    "```    \n",
    "actual objects are instantiated on the map and reduce nodes.  More precisely, a separate mapper class is instantiated in each map node and a reducer class is instantiated in each reducer node.  This means that the three mapper functions can pass state through `self`, e.g. `self.heap`.  Remember that to pass state between the map and reduce phase, you will have to use `yield` in the mapper and read each line in the reducer.\n",
